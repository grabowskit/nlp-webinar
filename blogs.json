Observability tools go beyond traditional monitoring to show SRE, DevOps, and IT teams what\u2019s going on and why problems occur within increasingly complex and dynamic infrastructure and application architectures, says Gagan Singh, vice president of product, observability, at Elastic. Those data-driven insights, in turn, help teams improve business results. \u201cOrganizations that adopt the observability mindset gain new levels of agility and the ability to deliver bigger, better customer experiences,\u201d Singh says. Observability tools are also gaining AI capabilities. New AIOps platforms use machine learning to collect, analyze, and utilize data, enabling enterprise apps to diagnose causes of system problems on the fly, reducing the time required for troubleshooting. Gartner predicts that, by 2025, more than half of DevOps teams will augment their tools with AIOps, up from less than 15% in 2020. Put cognitive search insight at the center Even when all the data is integrated and observable, it can still be difficult to find important data no matter where it resides, so that workers can solve problems and identify opportunities. That\u2019s why search technology that can connect cloud systems and various data sources inside an enterprise, and can apply machine learning and natural language understanding to improve the discovery of data \u2014 an approach sometimes called cognitive search \u2014 is critical. \u201cCognitive search enables companies to analyze and act upon far more data than we\u2019ve been able to consider in the past,\u201d says Mark Settle, a former CIO of Okta and now a business consultant and author.

Key takeaways Most companies aren't using the vast majority of their own data Cloud infrastructure services are key to unlocking that value Consolidating data, making it observable, and ensuring it's secure are critical steps to get there That path begins with tapping the full power of the cloud, Johal and other IT leaders say. To start, organizations must focus on a few areas that are key to successful cloud infrastructure services \u2014 data integration, observability, search, and security. Modernize data integration, both in cloud and on-prem One of the first steps for organizations is data integration \u2014 consolidating data from all its disparate sources. Companies can\u2019t even begin to put data to work when it\u2019s spread across a hodgepodge of cloud and on-premises systems.

{"body_content_window": " Business continuity for Elastic workloads during migration Cloud migration does not happen overnight, in fact, according to a report from McKinsey , 38% of cloud migration projects were behind schedule by more than one quarter and 13% were behind schedule by more than three quarters. With such a high-impact and potentially lengthy infrastructure change, it is critical to ensure the original workloads are not disrupted as environments evolve during the different stages of the migration journey. Good news, Elastic has the built-in capability to operate seamlessly across all environments, no matter what your environment looks like \u2013 fully on-premises, hybrid, or even multi-cloud \u2014 so none of your Elastic workloads will be impacted during migration. With the cross-cluster search feature, you can easily access data stored in both on-premises and cloud environments, in parallel. And, as you decommission the on-premises environments and scale out your cloud environments \u2013 including across multiple cloud providers, the cross-cluster search feature can also bring together the data stored in all your cloud environments under a single pane of glass \u2014 for improved visibility and faster time to insights. Optimized total cost of ownership with Elastic in the cloud One of the top reasons for organizations to migrate to the cloud is to reduce the total cost of ownership , but how can you put the native characteristics of cloud computing to use and optimize the costs of your Elastic workloads? Automatically migrate aging data to cheaper hardware with built-in data lifecycle management capabilities and a tiered architecture . Further reduce storage costs by storing less frequently accessed data in cost-effective object storage like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Microsoft Azure Blob Storage, and still have the ability to search across them with searchable snapshots . Harness the power of on-demand storage and compute through autoscaling , to ensure your resource capacity meets resource utilization while paying only for what you use. Reduce the time wasted on setting up new environments with the ability to hit the ground running through instantly provisioned Elastic deployments in any of the dozens of supported regions across Amazon Web Services (AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. Minimize data transfer costs by storing data closer to the source and using the cross-cluster search feature to access it so that only the data actually being used is sent across the network. Reduce costs associated with operational overhead by utilizing a managed service for Elastic , eliminating maintenance and upkeep, so you can focus resources on using the platform to help you run your business.", "name": "5 factors to consider when migrating Elastic to the cloud", "title": "5 factors to consider when migrating Elastic to the cloud | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-02-24", "byline": ["Fermi Fang"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/5-factors-to-consider-when-migrating-elastic-to-the-cloud"}
{"body_content_window": " Highly available and resilient Elastic deployments A 2021 outage in AWS took down services like Slack, Grindr, McDonalds App, and Epic Games Store, and a 2019 outage in Google Cloud took down Vimeo, Shopify, and Discord. To mitigate such risks, companies may opt for multi-zone failovers or even multi-region and multi-cloud active-active disaster recovery architectures. With Elastic Cloud's built-in multi-zone architecture , multi-zone fail-over is available in a straightforward way. To ensure a higher degree of disaster recovery, Elastic also has the capability to replicate data across cloud provider regions and across cloud providers , so that businesses can continue operating as usual even if an entire cloud region or an entire cloud provider goes down. Compliance when running in the cloud Many countries define and regulate their data sovereignty. To comply with regulatory requirements, companies need to store data locally instead of sending it across the Internet and storing it in another geographic location. This means you would need to set up multiple deployments around the world, but how can you put the data to use under a single unified view? Elastic Cloud enables companies to comply with data sovereignty regulations using cross-cluster search . Companies can easily search across all their data centers \u2014 so a business that runs an AWS instance in Cape Town, a Google Cloud instance in Hong Kong, and a Microsoft Azure instance in London can search all their data without actually moving their data. Cloud data security According to a study by ITPro Today, the biggest issue organizations are facing during cloud adoption is the complexity of cyber security. Security concerns may range from data and privacy protection to software vulnerabilities and denial of services. As you set up Elastic deployments in the cloud, you need to ensure it meets your organization\u2019s security and compliance requirements. Elastic Cloud (Elastisearch managed service) was designed from the ground up with security in mind \u2013 operating systems hardened, non-essential services turned off, and all of the components configured to communicate using encryption to protect both data in motion and data at rest.

When deciding on the optimal environment to deploy Elastic workloads, there are several essential factors that CIOs, IT managers, and cloud engineers should consider \u2014 elasticity, security, cost, reliability, and geographic coverage. In this blog, we will discuss how these five characteristics of cloud computing can be leveraged to maximize your Elastic experience and achieve the best return on your investment.", "name": "5 ways to enhance your Elastic experience with the cloud", "title": "5 ways to enhance your Elastic experience with the cloud | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-02-09", "byline": ["Fermi Fang"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/5-ways-to-enhance-your-elastic-experience-with-the-cloud"}
{"body_content_window": " On-demand scalability and elasticity Cloud computing is scalable, so you can freely add or remove infrastructure resources to meet your applications needs. Elastic allows you to quickly deploy and scale your Elastic workloads on the cloud. Skip the wait for server provisioning that could take weeks or months \u2014 and instantly spin up new deployments and scale with zero down-time through a few simple button clicks with the Elastic managed service . In today\u2019s always-on world, the opportunity cost of slow server setup can delay bringing new products to market, decrease productivity and negatively impact customer experiences. And, taking this one step further, the Elastic managed service enables you to match the resources allocated with the actual amount of resources needed at any given point in time with autoscaling. This helps ensure consistent performance and helps you get work done faster \u2014 for example you can scale up machine learning nodes for large anomaly detection and threat hunting jobs, then scale down when you're done, so you pay only for the resources you use. Built-in security Security continues to be a priority for industry professionals. When you run services on-premise, in your own data centers, all the security practices and postures are your responsibility. But when you run in the cloud, you benefit by leveraging dedicated security personnel and resources that cloud providers have in place. For example, when you run your applications on Microsoft Azure, they have over 3,500 cybersecurity experts who work on your behalf 24x7x365. And, the same principle applies to running Elastic. For instance, recently there was a widespread log4j vulnerability impacting organizations around the world. When Elastic learned of this vulnerability and how it affects our products, our engineering and security teams responded instantly to make sure our customers\u2019 information remained safe, and that they aware and equipped with the knowledge of how to use our products to combat Log4j2\u2019s vulnerabilities. When you run Elastic in the cloud, meeting your organization\u2019s security and compliance requirements becomes an easier lift. The Elastic managed service provides you with extra layers of security best practices that help to ensure your deployments are secured from the ground up \u2014 including but not limited to OS hardening, network security controls, and encryption for data in motion, as well as data at rest. Rest assured knowing that the Elastic managed service is also continuously audited by independent parties to meet data security, compliance, and industry-standard privacy requirements.", "name": "5 ways to enhance your Elastic experience with the cloud", "title": "5 ways to enhance your Elastic experience with the cloud | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-02-09", "byline": ["Fermi Fang"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/5-ways-to-enhance-your-elastic-experience-with-the-cloud"}
{"body_content_window": " Lower total cost of ownership One of the biggest perks of cloud computing is freeing yourself from the nitty gritty details of managing infrastructure \u2014 from networking and hardware provisioning to maintenance. When you self-manage Elastic in cloud environments, you may still need to set up virtual machines or configure each Elastic node to the right state and make sure the underlying system software is up-to-date \u2014all without impacting production workloads. Why go through the trouble, when you could spend your time focused on projects that deliver greater business value? The Elastic managed service helps you reduce operational overhead and maintenance costs while operating system updates and security patches are being applied in the background. Another perk of cloud computing is having instant access to a variety of hardware specs that are all priced at different hourly rates. With Elastic, you are able to maximize the benefits from these hardware choices through the use of three built-in features. Automatically migrate data as it ages to less expensive hardware with automated data lifecycle management and a tiered data architecture , and further reduce storage costs by storing less frequently accessed data in cost-effective object storage like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage, while still having the ability to search across them on-demand with searchable snapshots . Resiliency, availability, and reliability No matter how thorough your disaster recovery plan may be, there are always unexpected situations that can occur. Unexpected downtime can lead to expensive losses and reputation risk. Production systems, especially e-commerce platforms, rack up particularly expensive losses when they are unable to transact. Outages may be a fact of life, but customers of these systems still react unfavorably when they are unable to do and get the things they need. Proper systems architecture and reliable backups help minimize downtime and their associated impact. Elastic provides automatic continuous backups through snapshots with point-in-time recovery to speed up the recovery process. The Elastic managed service also provides an out-of-the-box multi-zone distributed architecture to avoid single points of failure that could bring down your deployment. On top of this, the Elastic managed service also has the capability to replicate data across cloud provider regions and actual cloud providers , so that you can continue operating as usual even if an entire cloud region or an entire cloud provider goes down.

Most enterprises use a mix of single cloud, multi-cloud, hybrid, and on-prem environments. Running Elastic Cloud will allow you to work across all these configurations , seamlessly, in a unified dashboard. You won\u2019t be held hostage to a single cloud provider or your data center, or have to worry about what happens if you migrate . Surface the data and patterns you need across all of them. (And if you\u2019re a multinational company, well, so are we. Don\u2019t worry about data sovereignty . We\u2019ve got you covered.) Business results that matter Every customer can do more with their data \u2013 and Elastic Cloud will help you unlock its potential. Walmart, for example, analyzed its data using Elastic and learned how to protect seniors from gift card scams , saving millions of dollars and countless cases of heartache and shame. In fact, Elastic powers search-powered technologies for thousands of satisfied customers , many of whom use our cloud-based solutions to reduce their cost of ownership, keep their data secure, and deploy and scale in mere minutes. Consider a customer like Zurich Insurance , one of the largest public companies in the world. The firm, with 55,00 employees in over 200 countries, has embraced Elastic as it retires legacy systems. Yet Elastic Cloud is able to integrate with those systems, and the new cloud-based ones the company is rolling out. The net effect is that data from over 40 cloud and on-prem systems, some as many as 40 years old, is at the fingertips of employees who need it, like customer service agents resolving claims. Only Elastic could deliver such a solution, and the way it\u2019s best delivered is via Elastic Cloud. Innovation that extends value No product in the marketplace can match Elastic Cloud\u2019s suite of features, like cross-cluster search and replication , autoscaling , frozen tiers and snapshot search , machine learning , and cutting edge network security , as economically. That\u2019s why we are continually recognized for excellence by Gartner , Forrester , Microsoft and Google , GigaOm and others. What this all means is that Elastic Cloud helps you provide a better digital customer experience . Stop thinking about patching, downtime, hardware procurement, data storage costs (since you can store your data in the cheapest frozen tier), availability \u2013 we manage that, so you can focus on them.", "name": "Why Elastic Cloud is the best way to use Elastic", "title": "Why is the best way to use Elastic in the cloud? | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-03-08", "byline": ["Paul Smalera"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-use-elastic-cloud-work-free-computing-kubernetes-enterprise-storage-server-solutions-pricing"}

Customers aren\u2019t patient \u2014 their demand for your services ebb and flow according to their needs, not yours. As a start, you can monitor their demands in real time using Elastic Observability , and even anticipate loads based on historical data. But if your stack can\u2019t handle spikes, whether planned or not, your customers will find another vendor. That\u2019s why Elastic Cloud is key to availability. Our solutions scale right along with your applications, keeping you a step ahead, and ready to serve. That\u2019s why customers tell Elastic that we are part of their organization's critical infrastructure. Speed, scalability, predictability Running Elastic Cloud is like having an \u201cEasy\u201d button for your setup, configuration, maintenance, and usage. Rather than wasting time and money making all the pieces work, Elastic Cloud quickly helps you connect your data and get going. Elastic Cloud offers all the tools you need to search, protect, and observe your IT investments, with seamless scalability to meet your users\u2019 needs and your business\u2019s expectations. By running across AWS, Azure, and Google, Elastic Cloud services allow you to leverage the additional redundancy and stability offered by a multi-cloud environment.

When the log4j2 vulnerability , which affected the entire internet, was first discovered, Elastic\u2019s mitigation was instantly available to Cloud customers\u2014protecting them while a software update to eliminate the vulnerability was prepared. It\u2019s worth noting that Elastic initially detected the vulnerability using Elastic Security \u2014 the exact suite of tools available to Elastic\u2019s Cloud customers. In fact, while Elastic engineers were diagnosing the vulnerability and creating a fix, they were using those same Elastic solutions to threat detect and secure the company\u2019s own applications and environments. Elastic patched hundreds of environments for customers during the vulnerability, but for customers running Elastic Cloud, the updates were being automatically applied.

Snapshot and restore is ideal when data in existing clusters need to be moved to Elastic Cloud, and the existing cluster is running an earlier Elasticsearch version than Elastic Cloud. 3. The other option is reindex from a cluster. This is best suited for when your data volumes are low and/or there are constraints to using a snapshot and restore, and the existing cluster is running an earlier Elasticsearch version than Elastic Cloud. Find more details on how to use the Reindex API in the migration guide . In this blog, we will provide the simple steps to automate your migration path with snapshot and restore. Automate your migration with snapshot and restore Let\u2019s go through how easy it is for you to migrate your data using snapshot and restore with Terraform (open-source infrastructure as code software). First, let\u2019s begin with the prerequisites and then we will cover the how-to steps. Prerequisites Verify that the target Elastic Cloud is running a version that is the same or higher than the current Elasticsearch clusters. A more detailed table of version compatibility is listed in the Elastic snapshot and restore guide . Check to confirm that the infrastructure capacity of the Elastic Cloud cluster is sufficient to accommodate the data volume and computing requirements for the use case. Check the listed limitations in the Elastic snapshot and restore guide, and version-specific breaking changes in the Elastic upgrade guide , to confirm that there are no constraints that affect the deployment\u2019s migration to Elastic Cloud. Check the correct version of Terraform software installed and also that the Terraform vault feature is enabled. Gather necessary information such as Elasticsearch API key ( var.apikey ) and AWS access key ( var.s3_client_access_key, var.s3_client_secret_key ).

As many developers shift to the cloud for the speed, flexibility, and cost-efficiency, they can deploy Elastic in their preferred public cloud, or in multiple clouds, and extend the value of Elastic with cloud-native features. Spin up instances for development, testing, and production to accelerate results that matter \u2014 securely and at scale. In this blog, we'll cover 6 ways Elastic Cloud delivers benefits to developers. 1. Get started quickly \u2014 it's easy Don't waste time sourcing, configuring, and managing hardware and software packages. You can quickly deploy Elastic on your preferred cloud service provider \u2014 no waiting around!", "name": "Six ways to streamline development with Elastic Cloud", "title": "Six ways to streamline development with Elastic Cloud | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-04-01", "byline": ["Nicole Williams"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/the-benefits-elastic-cloud-delivers-to-developers"}
{"body_content_window": " You can choose between Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure \u2014 and deploy in any of more than 50 supported regions . Whether you operate in a single cloud, or multiple clouds, Elastic helps you gain visibility across your global cloud environments. 2. Accelerate insights with serverless integrations Avoid the operational overhead of installing, configuring, and maintaining agent-based data shippers. Streamline the data ingestion process by leveraging out-of-the-box integrations with popular cloud services from AWS , Google Cloud , and Microsoft Azure . Can't find what you're looking for? No problem, we also offer agents, Beats, and other types of data shippers. In fact, Elastic has over 200+ integrations across various partners such as Cisco, Docker, Kafka, Kubernetes, Prometheus, and more. 3. Scale as you grow Take the guesswork out of capacity planning. Leverage autoscaling to ensure resource capacity matches resource utilization. As you ingest more data, autoscaling and index lifecycle management (ILM) policy work in conjunction to ensure your data tiers provide the required storage capacity. Getting ready to run a big anomaly detection or threat hunting job? Scale your ML nodes up and down to complete jobs as quickly as possible, while paying only for the resources you use. 4. Deliver reliability across the globe Don't stress about service reliability. Elastic provides capabilities to help ensure service resilience. With Elastic Cloud's built-in multi-zone architecture , you can avoid single points of failure that could bring down your deployment. Backups are automatic with snapshots and help speed up your restoration and recovery processes. You can also replicate data across clusters in different regions, and even different cloud service providers. With cross-cluster search you can help ensure users always find the information they are seeking \u2014 even if an entire cloud region or an entire cloud provider goes down. 5. Meet security and compliance requirements Not a security expert? We got you! Elastic Cloud is built from the ground up with security best practices in mind. You benefit from thousands of person-hours of experience in securing cloud environments and Elastic deployments \u2014 including but not limited to OS hardening, network security controls, and encryption for data in motion, as well as data at rest.

With the Elastic Common Schema (ECS) and single repository architecture, the same observability data from AWS and other data sets can also be used for extended detection and response (XDR) to drive mean time to detection towards zero with Elastic Security. Monitor hybrid cloud environments with Elastic Observability Stop threats quickly Elastic Security brings together SIEM, endpoint security, and cloud security allowing organizations to ingest and retain large volumes of data from diverse sources, store and search data for longer, and augment threat hunting with detections and machine learning. Eliminate data silos, reduce alert fatigue, and ready your organization to stop threats quickly, and at cloud scale, to minimize risk and protect your organization's reputation. Now let\u2019s discuss how you can inexpensively retain and manage data to retrieve and search as necessary. Secure cloud environments with Elastic Security Balance performance and costs \u2014 even as you scale Most organizations retain historical data to better understand patterns and improve their standard of operations, but often are challenged to optimize storage costs while maintaining data accessibility. Elastic added the Elasticsearch frozen tier to allow you to retain large amounts of historical data in low-cost object storage like Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) \u2014 while keeping it fully active and searchable. This allows organizations to safely keep their AWS and on-premises logs, events, and metrics for usage, analysis, and compliance purposes. Keep data \u2014 at any granularity, for any length of time \u2014 and then scale as the data grows. Data management and tiering is automated through index lifecycle management and autoscaling capabilities, based on your data performance, resilience, and retention requirements. With Elastic, you can automatically scale up or down, and pay only for the resources you use.", "name": "Elastic working with AWS to accelerate results that matter", "title": "Elastic and AWS: Working together to accelerate results that matter | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-04-05", "byline": ["Terry Birdsell", "Jennifer Jarred", "Uday Theepireddy"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-and-aws-working-together-to-accelerate-results-that-matter"}

The engagement and adoption is awesome to be a part of \u2014 anything that makes our customers\u2019 lives easier is a win for all of us. The biggest priority is elevating the customer value for and through each and every partnership. It\u2019s not on the customer to know how we can do more, it\u2019s on us. The opportunities to bring the best tools together to better serve them are astronomical. Isabelle: Our customers are able to get the best of both worlds. The investment that Elastic has made in our partnership with Google definitely makes a difference in the customer experience. Clients tell us that our tight integration with Google Cloud\u2019s marketplace and solutions makes procurement and data ingestion so much easier. Customers are also able to get seamless support from both sides to ensure that any questions are addressed quickly. Moreover, we\u2019ve worked particularly hard to resolve any roadblocks so we can provide as native of a service as possible. Adrienne: Being where our customers are and showing up how they want us to in the wildly evolving digital landscape requires flexibility. We have to be creative, we have to test and measure, and we have to be willing to fail fast and adjust quickly. Isabelle: We always have to think of new ways to deliver information to our customers and adapt as-needed based on the latest and best practices. I\u2019ve actually \u201cborrowed\u201d several great ideas from Adrienne in the past that were quite successful! Prioritizing channel partnerships means prioritizing relationships How do you approach our partnerships in a way that builds lasting trust and understanding? And how does that impact business priorities here at Elastic? Isabelle: Building and fostering relationships is instrumental to being successful in a channel function \u2014 it really should be a KPI! The strong ties that you build with your partners not only help you in your function, but also affect the reputation of your organization, as well. Adrienne: I agree. Partnerships are so multi-faceted and multi-functional that they truly revolve around relationships. Our team at Elastic is focused on scale and growth, but we also have fun.

This reputation goes a long way when it comes to collaborating to solve our customers\u2019 challenges. Celebrating a community of peers What does being named to the 2022 CRN Women of the Channel list mean to each of you, both personally and professionally?

But that success came with a price: 64% say they\u2019re more stressed out than they were a year ago. How can CISOs navigate a new set of challenges in 2022, while also regaining some much needed balance? We asked CISOs, security practitioners, and other experts where security leaders should be investing their time, energy, and resources in the year ahead.", "name": "Insights: 5 priorities for CISOs to regain much needed balance in 2022", "title": "Top 5 Areas CISOs Should Prioritize in 2022 | Elastic | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2021-09-27", "byline": ["Christopher"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/top-5-areas-cisos-should-prioritize-2022"}
{"body_content_window": " Here are five areas across workforce, tools, and methodology that they say should be priorities in the new year. Key takeaways Complex hybrid work environments will continue to evolve demands for CISOs CISOs should accelerate adoption of Zero Trust strategies Training and employee programs must expand to business and time management skills 1. Secure your hybrid workforce The transition into long-term hybrid work environments presents security challenges that few enterprises have encountered, says Katie Teitler, vice president of research at TAG Cyber, a cybersecurity research firm. \u201cIn 2021, it was all about securing remote work,\u201d Teitler says. \u201cHybrid work is a different paradigm. CISOs have to balance worker productivity with security in a way we\u2019ve never seen.\u201d If 2021 focused on security fundamentals, 2022 will be the year of identifying opportunities for improvement, with security pros becoming more adept at tactics and processes for ensuring every device is locked down. Security chiefs will need to manage access and establish governance for a constantly changing mix of in-office and at-home employees using personal and company devices \u2014 some of which escaped important software patches and updates during the pandemic. For many organizations, that means investing more in cloud-based extended detection and response, or XDR, which combines security information and event management (SIEM) with endpoint detection and response (EDR), analytics and intelligence, and identity and access management tools. A hybrid workforce in 2022, Teitler adds, \u201cwill mean supporting more different and disparate types of technologies and access requirements.\u201d 2. Embrace Zero Trust frameworks President Joe Biden\u2019s May 2021 executive order calling for improvements in national cybersecurity cited Zero Trust, a security methodology and framework built around the idea that no traffic on enterprise networks should be trusted, even if it\u2019s generated by authenticated users. \"Zero Trust is the opposite of the old proverb, 'trust, but verify.' It\u2019s a risk management approach that translates to trust nothing and record everything.\" Nate Fick,general manager of security, Elastic The Zero Trust security framework is becoming an essential tool in the CISO\u2019s arsenal, as it forces teams to rethink the way network access works and more closely scrutinize the products they rely upon. In 2022, experts say, security teams must better understand Zero Trust methodologies and products and be ready to implement them.", "name": "Insights: 5 priorities for CISOs to regain much needed balance in 2022", "title": "Top 5 Areas CISOs Should Prioritize in 2022 | Elastic | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2021-09-27", "byline": ["Christopher"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/top-5-areas-cisos-should-prioritize-2022"}
{"body_content_window": " Many of them got a head start during the pandemic: The crisis prompted 60% of enterprises to accelerate their adoption of Zero Trust. \u201cZero Trust is the opposite of the old proverb, \u2018trust, but verify,\u2019\u201d says Nate Fick, general manager of security at Elastic. \u201cIt\u2019s a risk management approach that translates to \u2018trust nothing and record everything.\u2019 With Zero Trust, security can become an enabler that allows smarter access to systems and data while delivering a greater level of protection.\u201d 3. Automate security workflows As security systems become more complex, human analysts can\u2019t keep tabs on current and potential threats at all times. That means an increased reliance on robotic process automation (RPA) and other tools to automate workflows of rote tasks. \u201cAutomation should free up some of the security team\u2019s time to focus on higher level analysis,\u201d says Teitler. For security organizations that rely on Zero Trust frameworks, automation tools can also handle routine issues on their own and escalate only those incidents that require human intervention \u2014 returning time to overburdened security analysts to focus on higher-level threats.

Commit to upskilling your team It\u2019s a good time to re-evaluate the skills on your security team and identify gaps \u2014 and not just technical ones. Developing and strengthening business acumen and soft skills now fall squarely on the shoulders of security leaders. For Liz Tluchowski, CIO and CISO of World Insurance Associates, a New Jersey\u2013based insurance brokerage with 1,400 employees and 131 offices across the US, helping her security team deepen its business analytics skills and communication strategies is a top priority in the coming year. As security professionals become a core part of the management team, they must understand the entire business process and be able to explain where their work fits in. CISOs must also invest in building an organization-wide security culture. The most common cyberattacks, after all, aren\u2019t caused by technical failings but result from social engineering or phishing exploits that take advantage of human error or oversight. \u201cSecurity professionals must learn to translate the arcana of their work into the language of business risk,\u201d Fick says. But it\u2019s also important that business leaders invest time in understanding the language of security too. \u201cGood management teams and boards must meet in the middle,\u201d he added.", "name": "Insights: 5 priorities for CISOs to regain much needed balance in 2022", "title": "Top 5 Areas CISOs Should Prioritize in 2022 | Elastic | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2021-09-27", "byline": ["Christopher"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/top-5-areas-cisos-should-prioritize-2022"}
{"body_content_window": " 5. Don\u2019t let your team (or yourself) burn out If there\u2019s one other priority CISOs shouldn\u2019t lose sight of heading into 2022, it\u2019s preserving better work-life balance \u2014 not just for their teams, but for themselves. Before COVID-19 sent them scrambling to manage cyber risks from home, the average enterprise security operations team chased down more than 110,000 security alerts each day, according to a 2020 Forrester study; less than half (47%) were able to keep up. As leaders focus on developing successful hybrid team models, they need to ensure that everyone gets sufficient time away from work. While major challenges lie ahead in 2022, smart CISOs can already look to the future as they think about solutions to these emerging issues. By embracing emerging security strategies like Zero Trust and improving automation tactics, they\u2019ll be better positioned to support the demands of a new hybrid workforce. What's next for CISOs Plan for the different ways employees will have to access data Automate as many security tasks as possible to free up overburdened teams Keep culture, skills training, and adequate PTO for everyone top of mind Christopher Null Christopher Null is a longtime technology, business, and entertainment journalist.

Yet every year, the attacks, breaches, and losses continue to increase. Employing the same tactics while expecting different results is not a rational approach to managing cybersecurity risk.", "name": "Insights: Why cybersecurity needs to be everyone's job - and 4 steps to get started", "title": "Why cybersecurity needs to be everyone\u2019s job\u2013and 4 steps to get started | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2021-11-04", "byline": ["Nate Fick"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-cybersecurity-needs-to-be-everyones-job-and-4-steps-to-get-started"}
{"body_content_window": " Some security tactics, of course \u2014 defining acceptable levels of risk, using liability insurance to transfer some of that risk, and mitigating damage when it happens \u2014 remain important in reducing the impact of attacks. Yet, business leaders need to rethink their organizational strategy. Enterprise security is too important to be the sole purview of a handful of specialists, as it has been for years. It needs to be enmeshed into everyone's job around the enterprise. Here are four strategies CISOs should consider to help put cyber risk management on a better path. 1. It\u2019s time to normalize cybersecurity risk First, organizations must change how they think about cyber risks. Cyberattacks have traditionally been seen as a unique, exogenous threat, separate from other aspects of corporate risk management. That needs to change. Cyber risk is business risk. It needs to be incorporated into every company\u2019s risk-management framework and managed with some of the same methodologies used in financial and operational risk modeling. If CFOs and COOs can sleep decently at night, so too should their security peers in the C-suite. In many ways, cybersecurity is not a technology problem, it\u2019s an organizational one. Security processes should be as fundamental to the enterprise as those for onboarding employees or designing great customer experiences. They need to receive the same consideration as every other necessary business function, along with commensurate funding and headcount. Security also needs to be more proactive and less reactive. Just as a company wouldn\u2019t wait to hire sales staff until after a product launch, it shouldn\u2019t wait for a major incident before it funds a cybersecurity team and puts the right processes in place. It\u2019s a given that organizations will continue to endure serious breaches; the more important question is whether they took reasonable measures to prevent them, and how effectively they respond. 2. Focus on people, processes, and technology \u2014 in that order Next, CISOs need to reconsider where they\u2019re focusing their resources. Their budgets should follow a clearly defined set of priorities, and tech should \u2014 in most cases \u2014 not be at the top. The first priority is people, and that means investing in training your employees in proper security hygiene, in teaching and reskilling your teams, and in strengthening a security culture. The next spending priority should be internal processes.", "name": "Insights: Why cybersecurity needs to be everyone's job - and 4 steps to get started", "title": "Why cybersecurity needs to be everyone\u2019s job\u2013and 4 steps to get started | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2021-11-04", "byline": ["Nate Fick"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-cybersecurity-needs-to-be-everyones-job-and-4-steps-to-get-started"}
{"body_content_window": " How thoroughly, for example, has the organization rehearsed what it will do in the event of a ransomware attack? Internal and external communications, operational continuity planning, and how (or whether) to engage with the attackers are all best planned before the crisis hits. Third, only after the most pressing issues around people and processes have been addressed, should CISOs invest in technology tools to help reduce and manage threats. 3. More carrots, fewer sticks Nearly 9 in 10 data breaches are the result of human error, according to a recent study by Stanford University researchers. And despite the more than $1 billion that companies spend annually on security awareness training, that\u2019s unlikely to change. Companies need to find new ways to reward good security practices. Shaming employees for security slipups, for instance, doesn\u2019t make them more vigilant. More often than not, it just scares them into silence and makes them less likely to speak up. Or they may try to solve the problem on their own and unknowingly make it worse. If they work in a highly regulated industry, that can lead to sanctions. Instead, organizations need to foster a culture of openness around security, encouraging employees to ask questions and raise red flags. Some companies send out simulated phishing attacks and reward employees who successfully identify them with gift cards and other perks. Others offer public recognition for employees who pass the required security training. Nearly any form of positive acknowledgment is a step in the right direction. 4. Make security tools easier to use Much of the billions of dollars companies spend on security technology goes toward shelfware that never gets used. In many cases, these are complicated tools that require experts who understand how to use them, and such people are in short supply. With a security labor shortage that isn\u2019t going away soon, according to the Information Systems Security Association (ISSA) and industry analyst firm Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG), security tech must become easier to use. Simpler tools would not only enable CISOs to hire more people to handle essential security functions, but also they would open up the workforce to a more diverse array of individuals with different backgrounds and tech expertise. Engineers also need to spend more time providing easy-to-understand dashboards that allow senior executives and other less technical people to understand the current state of risk.

{"body_content_window": " The past 18 months have increased challenges for corporate security chiefs, many of whom continue to face major internal challenges along with ongoing external threats. CISOs have navigated a sudden shift to remote work, a dramatic increase in cyber attacks and an increased workload due to shortages of security staff. They\u2019re also being assigned new tasks, such as compliance with privacy regulations. On top of all that, they face a fraught and uncertain relationship with their organizations. A recent EY survey of global information-security executives suggests those relations have never been more strained. \u201cGiven today\u2019s shape-shifting nature of doing business post-pandemic and an unrelenting threat landscape, CISOs arguably have the toughest job on the organizational chart,\u201d says Manoj Bhatt, head of cybersecurity advisory at Telstra Purple, a technology consulting firm owned by Telstra, Australia\u2019s largest telecommunications provider. Making it tougher, many C-suite colleagues fail to understand security risks and don\u2019t appreciate that cyber attacks are inevitable, says Matthew Rosenquist, CISO at Eclipz, a Silicon Valley provider of encryption technology, who also writes and speaks frequently about the challenges facing security executives. This can put cybersecurity leaders in no-win situations. \u201cIf you do a poor job and the company experiences loss from attacks, the CEO says, \u2018Why do we need you?\u2019\u201d Rosenquist explains: \u201cIf you do a great job and there\u2019s no loss at all, the execs will still say \u2018Well, everything\u2019s fine so we don\u2019t need you.\u2019\u201d Veteran CISOs and other security experts say better communications with other C-suite leaders and board members can go a long way toward easing tensions at the top and reducing the pressure they\u2019re under. Here are several strategies they suggest to foster empathy and understanding with those key groups. 1. Set realistic expectations and empower C-suite with details Most CISOs understand the threats they face and what\u2019s being done to forestall them. It\u2019s their job to make sure other executives have the same knowledge. If leaders understand that breaches are a business reality and are confident in the countermeasures, they\u2019re less likely to feel blindsided. \u201cEveryone sees news of breaches all the time, so you have to be out there talking to people about how this risk relates to your company and what systems we have in place, in order to give the broader context,\u201d says Hayslip.", "name": "Insights: C-Suite undervalues CISOs and cyberattack risks", "title": "C-Suite undervalues CISOs and cyberattack risks | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2021-11-04", "byline": ["Melanie Warner"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/c-suite-undervalues-cisos-and-cyberattack-risks"}
{"body_content_window": " At SoftBank, Hayslip makes a point to meet with other department leaders to understand their business objectives, the critical resources they have that need protection and the friction that security measures may be creating for their teams. He sees his role not simply as a technical leader but as a \u201cbusiness executive who manages risk,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t just sit in your security box and be the master of your domain.\u201d 2. Know your audience to communicate effectively As the top security executive, the CISO serves as an important liaison between business departments and InfoSec teams. Communicating effectively requires understanding their priorities and speaking their language, not the complex jargon of cybersecurity and IT. Only about a third of CISOs, though, say they have strong communications skills, according to a recent survey by ClubCISO, a London-based organization of 500 global cybersecurity leaders. And while the survey notes that business knowledge is far more important to the job than technical knowledge, only a minority of CISOs say they have enough of those skills. That\u2019s why knowing your internal audience is so critical. \u201cIf it\u2019s an HR audience, I might discuss the confidentiality of sensitive employee data,\u201d says Rosenquist. \u201cFinance teams are interested in the integrity of their records and processes. Product line executives want to know how security controls will impact profitability and product plans.\u201d 3. Measure what will make you noticed After the CEO, the most important C-suite colleague of the CISO is the chief financial officer, who controls budgeting. A positive CFO relationship can help make more resources available to ease workloads and for other security initiatives. Hard data is an essential tool when working with finance chiefs (and with other business leaders). Some CISOs provide data showing the number of threats that were thwarted over the past 12 or 18 months, how they were defended, and what the attackers were aiming for, says Khalid Kark, CIO Program Research Leader at Deloitte. One CISO in the financial services sector, Kark recalls, created custom cyber-risk dashboards for each of his C-suite colleagues and other business leaders, allowing them to regularly check a menu of security metrics. \u201cIn cybersecurity, what gets measured gets noticed,\u201d Kark says.", "name": "Insights: C-Suite undervalues CISOs and cyberattack risks", "title": "C-Suite undervalues CISOs and cyberattack risks | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2021-11-04", "byline": ["Melanie Warner"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/c-suite-undervalues-cisos-and-cyberattack-risks"}
{"body_content_window": " \u201cHaving defined metrics helps tell the story.\u201d Hopeful signs ahead The ClubCISO survey suggests a more positive outlook for CISOs heading into 2022: 86% of CISOs said their organizations now view security as being as important as they do, up from 65% before the pandemic. And nearly 70% of respondents agreed that their organizations have a positive security culture, up from 45% in 2020. Meanwhile, individual CISOs are finding their own ways to combat stress. Rosenquist unwinds by riding his motorcycle in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, nearby his home near Sacramento. \u201cIt\u2019s something totally predictable that you have total control over,\u201d Rosenquist says. \u201cTotally different from cybersecurity.\u201d Hayslip and his wife recently booked a Hawaiian cruise, their first vacation requiring air travel in years. \u201cIn this field,\u201d he says, \u201cyou have to have ways of detaching.\u201d Melanie Warner Freelance Journalist, Melanie Warner is a freelance journalist based in Boulder, Colorado, and the author of The Magic Feather Effect (Scribner, 2019) and Pandora\u2019s Lunchbox (Scribner, 2013).

{"body_content_window": " The global security workforce needs to grow by 65% to become fully staffed, according to a new study by (ISC)\u00b2, the world\u2019s largest organization for cybersecurity pros. While modern IT platforms and tools can certainly automate many low-level tasks to help relieve overburdened security teams, chief information security officers must still find better ways to retain existing workers and recruit new ones. If they don\u2019t, those unfilled positions represent a significant source of risk, security leaders say. Staff shortages are causing misconfigured systems, oversights in following security procedures, rushed deployments, and an inability to recognize new threats \u2014 the very kind of lapses that often lead to breaches. \u201cIt really does leave organizations more vulnerable if they don\u2019t have adequately staffed cybersecurity teams,\u201d says Clar Rosso, chief executive of(ISC)\u00b2. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has made the problem especially acute. More than a quarter of security staffers temporarily left their jobs or worked reduced hours during the pandemic, according to the (ISC)\u00b2 report. In response, leading CISOs are adopting new strategies to fill open positions, and to keep their most valuable existing workers from jumping ship. Recruit outside of IT Because there aren\u2019t enough highly skilled cybersecurity professionals to go around, CISOs and HR leaders are increasingly looking outside the traditional IT talent pool to find prospects with the aptitude and adaptable skills. It\u2019s becoming more common for younger cybersecurity workers to start their careers outside of IT. According to the (ISC)\u00b2 study, just 38% of Gen Z and Millennial security pros started out in IT, compared with 53% of Gen Xers and 55% of Baby Boomers. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to fill a 2.7 million job gap by hiring the same people,\u201d Rosso says. For people changing careers, cybersecurity is an attractive field: It has open positions in every region of the world with employers in different industries, and holds the promise of steady advancement. Indeed, 77% of cybersecurity pros surveyed by (ISC)\u00b2 said that they were satisfied or extremely satisfied in their jobs, the highest levels ever reported in the annual study. CISOs are increasingly considering candidates with problem-solving ability, communication skills, curiosity, and willingness to learn, as well as strong strategic thinking.", "name": "Insights: How CISOs can better manage an emerging risk - unified roles", "title": "How CISOs can better manage an emerging risk: unfilled roles | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2021-12-17", "byline": ["Matt Palmquist"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/how-cisos-better-manage-emerging-risk-unfilled-roles-insights-leadership"}
{"body_content_window": " For those prospects, CISOs \u201cwill invest in training for the technical skills,\u201d says Rosso. The military, government agencies, and trade schools are all rich sources of skills that are \u201creadily transferable to cybersecurity roles,\u201d says a 2020 study from Kudelski Security, a global cybersecurity company. For example, Hiring Our Heroes , a foundation supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, offers 14-week cybersecurity \u201cboot camps\u201d for veterans interested in making a career jump. Target diversity recruitment Recruiting from outside the IT universe also presents an opportunity for CISOs to make progress with diversity goals. Women make up just 25% of the global cybersecurity workforce, the (ISC)\u00b2 reports, and non-white employees hold only 28% of the cybersecurity jobs in North America and in the U.K. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that our industry faces serious future risks if it doesn\u2019t find ways to recruit new talent to its ranks and fill the growing number of vacancies. But more than that, its current lack of diversity poses its own more immediate risks because company systems aren\u2019t homogenous and neither are potential assailants,\u201d says Mandy Andress, chief information security officer at Elastic. Bringing up those numbers has a potentially greater impact beyond equity; it also supports core security objectives. Broadening the range of educational, geographic, neurodiverse and LGBTQ constituencies in cybersecurity can better equip security teams to assess and manage an ever-widening array of threats. Andress added that the cybersecurity team she leads as an LGBTQIA+ female CISO includes people who represent the array of human nature when it comes to neurodiversity, sexual orientation, gender identity, race, and age. The picture is just as varied when it comes to background, educational pathway, and industry experience. \u201cIn a multidisciplinary field like this, different perspectives are critical. When threats and tactics change around us daily, the diverse viewpoints on my team help counter complacency by bringing new thinking to situations,\u201d says Andress. Internally, companies can recruit more diverse candidates by writing job descriptions that aren\u2019t overloaded with technical jargon.", "name": "Insights: How CISOs can better manage an emerging risk - unified roles", "title": "How CISOs can better manage an emerging risk: unfilled roles | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2021-12-17", "byline": ["Matt Palmquist"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/how-cisos-better-manage-emerging-risk-unfilled-roles-insights-leadership"}

Less than 40% of organizations surveyed in 2021 by Hays, an IT executive search firm, said they could effectively retain the cybersecurity talent they recruited. Because compensation is so competitive, companies must distinguish themselves in other ways like professional development. Paying for training and certification courses, and helping plot new career paths that promise steady advancement, can be highly effective. \u201cWill you retrain people? Will you bring people in at a more junior level and give them a mentor or leaders to develop them further? Those are important factors,\u201d says Christine Wright, senior vice president at Hays. The shift to remote work during the pandemic could ultimately pay dividends by giving employers a new perk to recruit and retain security pros. \u201cThe pandemic has freed me to stop asking people to move to one of a few cities and instead allows me to meet talent where they are in the country or the world,\u201d says Justin Berman, CISO at healthcare company Thirty Madison. \u201cThe ability to collaborate, communicate, and function as a team across diverse locations was always critical, but now it\u2019s a strategic differentiator on hiring, because if you won\u2019t let them, someone else will.\u201d Matt Palmquist is a freelance business journalist and former contributing editor of Strategy+Business magazine.

Elastic Agent and the Java APM agent are both connected to an Elastic cluster running on our Elasticsearch Service Guides are available for APM and Elastic Agent . Scenario: Application exploited Let\u2019s walk through a hypothetical, but very real, situation many organizations went through. As the news of Log4Shell began to emerge, our vulnerable application was exposed and, unfortunately, exploited. We\u2019ll now assume the role of a security analyst team who has just noticed a few alerts fire in Elastic Security. At this point, they do not know it is a Log4Shell exploit attempt \u2014 they will use the data and views available to them to investigate and get to the root cause. Kicking off the investigation Our analyst team notices two alerts fire in very quick succession. The alerts state that a Suspicious JAVA Child Process was detected, followed by a Malware Prevention attempt. Using some of the views in Kibana, the analysts are able to get more details about the events in question. Our analysts are able to see that java ran a process that eventually ended up downloading \u201cMozi.a\u201d via wget. Thanks to the endpoint security integration, that file wasn\u2019t able to run because it was determined to be malware. Based on this knowledge, our analyst team determines that this is a true positive, and should be investigated further. In the Elastic Security overview page, they can see that a 0-day vulnerability in Log4j2 was recently announced and is actively being exploited.", "name": "Security: Investigate Log4Shell exploits with Elastic Security and Observability", "title": "Investigate Log4Shell exploits with Elastic Security and Observability | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-01-13", "byline": ["James Spiteri"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/investigate-log4shell-exploits-with-elastic-security-and-observability"}
{"body_content_window": " Since java was invoked to download and execute a malicious file, they decide to investigate further to see if that host in particular is running any vulnerable java applications. Using the Observability inventory view within Kibana, they check the processes currently running on the host and perform a search for \u201cjava.\u201d They see a java process running with the same process id that was identified within the security alerts. However, they decide to dig a bit deeper to confirm that the vulnerable libraries are being used that are mentioned in the news feed. Using Osquery within the same view, they run a query to determine this, based on the article they found shared by fleetdm . Within the Osquery results, they see that the java application in question is, in fact, using the Log4j2 library, as well as the JNDI lookup class: Based on these findings, they already had substantial evidence that the likelihood of Log4j2 being exploited in their application is very high. Digging deeper, the analysts switch to the APM view in Kibana, checking the running services that are being instrumented. They notice the application in question based on the filtered host, the time range, and the service name they previously identified. They notice the following transaction was triggered for that service and click to discover more. The transaction shows them that almost immediately after the request was received by the application, an additional GET request was made to another web server. Based on other traces for this application, this did not seem normal. They could see a backend service was added to their application service map for that time period. It was not present at any other time. After clicking on the first line in the trace, they view the metadata collected. They see a request header, \u201cX-Api-Version,\u201d was sent containing an unusual value, which also looked similar to requests seen in the news feed for Log4Shell: Clicking on the GET request in the transaction span, they see exactly what their application asked for in the request. They also see the stack trace that was generated. Our analysts are able to observe that \u201cExploitAL8hS9wdf7.class\u201d was downloaded via the java application from 10.88.0.1 on port 8888. From the stack trace, they see that the source was indeed the Log4j JNDI Manager lookup function. They also check for any application logs generated during this transaction, as their deployment also correlated logs and metrics.", "name": "Security: Investigate Log4Shell exploits with Elastic Security and Observability", "title": "Investigate Log4Shell exploits with Elastic Security and Observability | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-01-13", "byline": ["James Spiteri"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/investigate-log4shell-exploits-with-elastic-security-and-observability"}
{"body_content_window": " They immediately notice that the same value they saw in the \u201cX-Api-Version\u201d request header was logged. Based on this, it seems like their application is logging this header by design. The contents of the header seem to be encoded with base64, so they decode the value: They notice that the decoded contents are the same commands detected in the alerts they first began investigating in Elastic Security. Based on all the above, they confirmed that their application seems to be vulnerable to Log4shell, and was indeed exploited. Conclusion As security analysts, sometimes we forget the opportunity available to us at the intersection of Observability and Security. Observability data, even when we remember to use it, is usually available in a different system and not easily accessible. Hopefully, this blog has allowed you to understand the value of having security and observability data within the same platform. At Elastic, we know that it\u2019s not always possible to instrument applications at this level. It\u2019s not a trivial task. We\u2019re working hard to address this and provide ways to allow organizations to be able to get this level of insight easily.

{"body_content_window": " Summary of CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell) Log4j2 is an open source logging framework incorporated into many Java based applications on both end-user systems and servers. In late November 2021 , Chen Zhaojun of Alibaba identified a remote code execution vulnerability, ultimately being reported under the CVE ID : CVE-2021-44228 , released to the public on December 10, 2021. The vulnerability is exploited through improper deserialization of user-input passed into the framework. It permits remote code execution and it can allow an attacker to leak sensitive data, such as environment variables, or execute malicious software on the target system. The identified vulnerability impacts all versions of Log4j2 from version 2.0-beta9 to version 2.14.1. Early methods to patch the issue resulted in a number of release candidates, culminating in recommendations to upgrade the framework to Log4j2 2.15.0-rc2 at the time of this post. Given the trivial complexity and the nature of observed widespread exploitation, mitigation should be considered critical in any environment that has identified software leveraging vulnerable versions of Log4j2. Detecting Exploitation of Log4Shell in Elastic Security Elastic Security users can use the following Event Correlation detection rule to identify active exploitation of the Log4j2 vulnerability.

{"body_content_window": " Additional Mitigation Strategies Outside of the recommended guidance from the Apache team regarding the deployment of the latest, patched versions of the Log4j2 framework to update, a number of mitigations have been widely suggested to prevent exploitation: Fastly have suggested checking if your version of Log4j supports executing the JVM with JAVA_OPTS=-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true to disable the lookup functionality to the remote server. This should apply to versions 2.10.0 through 2.15.0.

{"body_content_window": " Many readers have further questions as to how we\u2019re tracking this issue within Elastic Security, what our coverage is now, and what we\u2019re expecting to do next. This post outlines a few details for our current status, and provides details regarding a new, related vulnerability: CVE-2021-45046. Elastic Security response As you may imagine, the team has worked tirelessly to ensure that we\u2019re developing detections for both active exploitation of the vulnerability, as well as post-compromise indicators, and will continue active development until further notice. We\u2019re spending time focusing on detailed detections that better align with some of the emerging trends that adversaries are now taking advantage of as they have time to develop their attack strategies. And we\u2019re not working in silence \u2014 those that may have had a chance to catch up on our original post a few days ago will be pleasantly surprised we\u2019ve added further detections and hunting examples, and will continue to do so as we learn more with the community. Alongside the threat research and signature development, we\u2019ve noted some interesting observations: We noted several instances of generic crypto miners for Linux being deployed that appeared to be related to exploitation of this CVE, but determined that they are benign true positives We\u2019ve stopped at least eight different families of malware being deployed using the log4j exploit, indicating widespread adoption of the exploit by threats of all kinds While we are observing coverage across our full protection suite (such as behavior protection), it is noteworthy that our free basic-tier malware protection is successfully preventing initial access We will aim to keep users and readers apprised of findings, and hope to share additional observations in the wild as we see them. A new contender: CVE-2021-45046 While we watch the CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell) vulnerability dominate the news cycles, a new contender, CVE-2021-45046 , was accidentally introduced to Log4j2j version 2.15.0, allowing adversaries to invoke a Denial of Service, and a remote code execution condition through specially crafted payloads. Previous mitigations to avoid Information Disclosure vulnerabilities by setting the `log4j2.noFormatMsgLookup` state to `true` do not mitigate against this new finding, according to the CVE details.", "name": "Security: Analysis of Log4Shell vulnerability & CVE-2021-45046", "title": "Analysis of Log4Shell vulnerability CVE-2021-45046 | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2021-12-15", "byline": ["Jake King"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/analysis-of-log4shell-cve-2021-45046"}
{"body_content_window": " While initially CVE-2021-45046 carried a lower CVSS score of 3.7 due to the impact of the initially discovered condition that can be invoked, this was re-evaluated to a 9.0 indicating limited remote code execution was possible. The finding was shared on December 16, 2021 by Alvaro Mu\u00f1oz , who identified that while the default setting formatMsgNoLookups was accurately set to true, there were alternative locations for lookups to take place. Technical details are still unfolding from the community, however the Log4j2 team shared the following message within their security updates: The reason these measures are insufficient is that, in addition to the Thread Context attack vector mentioned above, there are still code paths in Log4j where message lookups could occur: known examples are applications that use Logger.printf(\"%s\", userInput), or applications that use a custom message factory, where the resulting messages do not implement StringBuilderFormattable. There may be other attack vectors. The safest thing to do is to upgrade Log4j to a safe version, or remove the JndiLookup class from the log4j-core jar. Reference here Given this new information, and readily available POCs available for exploitation, the Apache team has recommended those impacted upgrade to the latest, safe version of Log4j2, or alternatively remove the JndiLookup class from the log4j-core jar. Elastic Security has observed many threat actors and benign scanners leveraging this new methodology already in some edge environments, with payloads incorporating previous attack methodologies such as key extraction attempts and base64 encoded payloads: A preview of the rapid acceleration of scanning attempts adopting this new vulnerability We anticipate adding further details as we learn them, and thank the team at lunasec specifically for providing a detailed, early summary of this emerging situation, and of course, provide kudos to Alvaro Mu\u00f1oz of Github Security Lab for the findings.

{"body_content_window": " It is one of the most popular logging libraries online and it offers developers a means to log a record of their activity that can be used across various use-cases: code auditing, monitoring, data tracking, troubleshooting/tweaking, and more. Log4j2 is an open-source, free software that is used by some of the largest companies in the world. How and why is Log4j2 being exploited? In late November 2021 , a remote code execution vulnerability was identified, reported under the CVE ID: CVE-2021-44228 , and released to the public on December 10, 2021. The vulnerability is accessed and exploited through improper deserialization of user-input passed into the framework. It allows remote code execution and it lets an attacker leak sensitive data, such as environment variables, or execute malicious software on the target system which can have a dangerous domino effect. As we know, this is a serious matter and we have already seen its effects across various companies from Minecraft and Oracle to even some of our products here at Elastic . The U.S. government has issued a warning to companies to remain vigilant and be on high alert over the holidays for potential cyberattacks and ransomware issues. The identified vulnerability impacts all versions of Log4j2 from version 2.0-beta9 to version 2.14.1. Early methods to patch the issue resulted in a number of release candidates, culminating in recommendations to upgrade the framework to Log4j2 2.15.0-rc2. For a more detailed look into how and why bad actors are using this vulnerability exploit, please refer to our blog about how to detect the log4j2 exploitation using Elastic Security . How Elastic is approaching the Log4j2 exploit and the issues surrounding it When Elastic learned of this vulnerability and how it affects our products, our engineering and security teams worked hard to ensure that our customers remained safe, aware, and were equipped with the knowledge of how to use our products to combat Log4j2\u2019s vulnerabilities. We released an up-to-date advisory that outlines Elastic\u2019s response, affected and unaffected products, updates, and more. We are also pleased to announce new versions of Elasticsearch and Logstash, 7.16.2 and 6.8.22 , which upgrade to the latest release of Apache Log4j and address false positive concerns with some vulnerability scanners could be impacted.", "name": "Security: The Log4j2 Vulnerability: What to know, tools to learn more, and how Elastic can help", "title": "The Log4j2 Vulnerability: What to know, tools to learn more, and how Elastic can help | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2021-12-20", "byline": ["Cole Henry"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/log4j2-vulnerability-what-to-know-security-vulnerability-learn-more-elastic-support"}

A deep dive on UAC Bypass is available to read here . The Elastic Security Research team has identified new detection strategies to overcome the bypass methodologies used by adversaries to silently deploy malware onto an endpoint and elevate privileges without the end-user knowing. Malware often requires full administrative privileges on a machine to perform more impactful actions, such as adding an antivirus exclusion, encrypting secured files, or injecting code into system processes.", "name": "Exploring Windows UAC bypasses: Techniques and detection strategies", "title": "Exploring Windows UAC bypasses: Techniques and detection strategies | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-02-21", "byline": ["Security Intelligence & Analytics Team"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/exploring-windows-uac-bypasses-techniques-and-detection-strategies"}
{"body_content_window": " Even if the targeted user has administrative privileges, the prevalence of User Account Control (UAC) means that the malicious application will often default to medium integrity, preventing write access to resources with higher integrity levels. Mandatory Integrity Levels (MIC) provides a mechanism for controlling access to securable objects. This work builds on the UAC research we\u2019ve recently conducted. To bypass this restriction, an attacker will need a way to elevate integrity levels silently without user interaction or a UAC prompt. This technique is known as a UAC bypass and relies on a variety of primitives and conditions, the majority of which are based on piggybacking elevated Windows features. In the article , written by Samir Bousseaden , a few common evasion methodologies were discussed in detail, outlining the complex steps adversaries take when approaching this method of attack: His findings detailed these methods, and several detection mechanisms shared by other community members This highlights how effective Elastic Security is at detecting tactics leveraged by adversaries to compromise an endpoint. Further details are available in the article . While much of this research has been sourced from adversarial observations provided by the community, Elastic\u2019s unique vantage point provides incredible insights into common malware families that take advantage of these mechanisms. Below you can see a quick overview of the top commonly observed UAC bypass methods used by malware families, observed by Elastic Security: Method Malware Family UAC Bypass via ICMLuaUtil Elevated COM Interface DarkSide , LockBit , TrickBot UAC Bypass via ComputerDefaults Execution Hijack ClipBanker , Quasar RAT UAC Bypass via Control Panel Execution Hijack AveMaria , Trojan.Mardom UAC Bypass via DiskCleanup Scheduled Task Hijack RedLine Stealer , Glupteba UAC Bypass via FodHelper Execution Hijack Glupteba , BitAT dropper UAC Bypass Attempt via Windows Directory Masquerading Remcos RAT The complexity of adversarial behaviors is nothing to be ignored, and with the broader detections highlighted in this article, Elastic Security provides coverage extensively with 26 prebuilt endpoint behavior protections for UAC bypasses.

{"body_content_window": " From the other direction, developers can shift left to integrate security early in the development process, avoiding slowdowns and even increased risk from considering security compliance after the fact. The benefits are there, but converging across silos is easier said than done. How do you get your leaders and their teams on board for closer collaboration? Here are some tips to lean into the future of DevSecOps . People: Practice incident response with your IT and security teams It\u2019s a common saying among security professionals that \u201ccybersecurity is a team sport.\u201d Cross-team and even inter-organization collaboration can make or break response to a breach. This kind of thinking wasn\u2019t always the case. \u201cIn the past, monitoring and mitigating security threats throughout an organization may have been seen as the province of an organization\u2019s security team,\u201d writes 451 Research , part of S&P Global Market Intelligence. As data breaches escalate in intensity and cost , threat prevention and response require all hands on deck, from incident responders containing threats to communications teams mitigating reputational damage after a breach to IT teams integrating security into technology development and deployment. Sports and cybersecurity share common ground with another saying: practice makes perfect. Practice can range in form from employees completing security awareness training to response teams running tabletop exercises. Mandy Andress, CISO of Elastic, recommends this tip for cyber defense : \u201cHaving a mitigation plan in place that is rehearsed regularly with your IT and security teams and your executive leadership will make it easier to deliver a swift and intentional response to a data breach disclosure.\u201d Intentionally drilling incident response plans with your security _and _IT teams helps everyone be prepared. Process: Streamline processes with a single platform 451 Research points out an overlap of objectives that makes closer alignment between observability and security processes mutually beneficial: \u201cThe ability to triage and identify security issues is part of observability, and the ability to act upon and isolate problem infrastructure should be integrated into modern business technology systems.\u201d Despite common goals, observability and security data may reside in separate systems. What if the data representing the intersection of security and observability was available to both teams? The power of an integrated approach is that it could weave observability and security teams and processes closer together.", "name": "How to build collaboration across security and DevOps teams\u2013and why it\u2019s business critical", "title": "How to build collaboration across security and DevOps teams\u2013and why it\u2019s business critical | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-03-15", "byline": ["Jennifer Ellard"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/how-to-build-collaboration-across-security-and-devops-teams-business-critical"}
{"body_content_window": " It could also provide another layer of data insights, with observability data adding context to logs to show actions, behaviors, and threat actor exploitation techniques. An integrated platform approach provides opportunities to streamline and scale processes such as investigative work, threat hunting, and threat profiling. It also follows the trend of vendor consolidation that Gartner predicts for 2022 , with organizations working to combat the inefficiencies of tool complexity. Technology: Leverage holistic security and observability solutions for monitoring Another common saying: People make mistakes. Holistic monitoring tools can help catch potential security exposures in development work before it\u2019s too late. Continuous monitoring is a DevSecOps ideal that has applications for security, auditing, compliance, and performance. Andress recommends , \u201cUse an external scanning system that continuously monitors for exposed databases.\u201d She continues, \u201cThese tools immediately notify security teams when a developer has mistakenly left sensitive data unlocked. There are holistic security and observability solutions that can scan both internally and externally.\u201d Where to start? While these three examples touch on people, process, and technology, all are not made equal. To start building collaboration across security and DevOps teams \u2014 and gaining the benefits from DevSecOps practices \u2014 focus on people first. The right technology or streamlined processes won\u2019t make as much of an impact on DevSecOps collaboration if roles aren\u2019t filled with skilled talent. Andress advises building teams with individuals who can \u201ccreatively apply technology to your environment, adapt defenses to new threats, and communicate to your users with a high degree of empathy.\u201d In addition, leadership needs to be on board for change to happen. Executives such as the CIO and CISO have an opportunity to set the tone at the top . Once the right teams and clear leadership objectives are in place, then it\u2019s time to ensure there is common understanding of technology and processes. As 451 Research states: \u201cTo achieve secure development at the speed of modern IT, cooperating teams must be literate in the tools and tactics essential to maintaining the pace required.\u201d While effecting change is easier said than done, starting to explore where security and observability converge into DevSecOps practices can ultimately help businesses serve and safeguard their customers.

According to pymnts.com , over 10% of customers reported a digital debit or credit card fraud incident in 2021. Social media also proved to be a hotbed for fraud with 8.8% of surveyees reporting fraud attacks. While these figures may seem relatively tame, the Federal Trade Commission reported a 45% increase in total fraud attacks between 2019 and 2020. A J.P. Morgan study estimated that the cost of fraud and theft for consumers to be $1.6 Billion in 2020 alone.", "name": "Catching a Fraudster: 4 modern ways technology is securing digital payments", "title": "4 modern ways to secure digital payments\u2014and catch fraudsters | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-03-30", "byline": "[Brandon Mavleos\"]", "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/modern-ways-to-secure-digital-payments-and-catch-fraudsters"}
{"body_content_window": " In response to these trends, the need for modernized fraud technology is top of mind for the industry. One study reports that the global online payment fraud detection market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 15% by 2028. This will come from a variety of vendors that help support verification, investigation, and decisioning of fraud. Here are 4 modern ways that the industry is advancing the use of technology to fight fraudsters. Biometric Liveness Detection Biometrics are nothing new to the payments industry. Ever since the widespread adoption of mobile devices, methods like fingerprint, retina & facial recognition have become the de facto way of authenticating users across applications. Improvements in static recognition of particular features such as eye or hair color, has improved the confidence of such technology. Still, bad actors have found ways of spoofing these services through the use of photos, videos, or recordings of the user. Thus the newest developments in liveness detection technology has created a more secure way of stopping bad actors from accessing financial and payment details. Liveness detection uses a variety of triggers to ensure that a \u2018live\u2019 user is in front of the screen. This may consist of \u2018active liveness\u2019 where the user needs to perform an action (e.g. blink), or \u2018passive liveness\u2019 which doesn\u2019t require any movement, but instead relies on algorithms. While \u2018active liveness provides greater security, there is a tradeoff as it takes longer, and increases the probability of abandonment. Still, whichever liveness method is used, it still presents a far greater layer of security versus traditional usernames & password. Improvements in 3D Secure Protocols 3D Secure (or 3DS) has been around for over 20 years, and is an important protocol in preventing fraud and accelerating commerce. The security layer creates an authentication data connection between merchants, payment networks and financial institutions, enabling the ability to share more intelligence about transactions. However the original 3DS had several drawbacks. The authentication system was slow and required the customer to respond and click on several notifications. \u201cMerchants knew it was an effective tool in preventing fraud, but they had to make the decision of whether to protect themselves against fraud or create friction that could lead to abandonment of transactions,\u201d says JJ Kieley at American Express \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t a great experience.\u201d The new 2.0 version builds on this, by expanding the number of transaction attributes that an issuer can leverage to authenticate a customer.", "name": "Catching a Fraudster: 4 modern ways technology is securing digital payments", "title": "4 modern ways to secure digital payments\u2014and catch fraudsters | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-03-30", "byline": "[Brandon Mavleos\"]", "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/modern-ways-to-secure-digital-payments-and-catch-fraudsters"}
{"body_content_window": " It also uses token based and biometric authentication, eliminating the need for static passwords. The protocol supports modern payment vehicles like wearables & digital wallets and helps improve risk assessment. This means a faster, more secure checkout experience for customers. Source: Visa Protecting PII on the Backend The rise in fraud cases is no secret - consumers are still suspicious of digital channels, and are worried about fraud and identity theft. According to a recent study , fifty-five percent of consumers do not store their payment credentials due to wariness of security protocols, and 57% are likely to abandon an online platform if they feel their information is not adequately protected. This is not without warrant, as the average online business experienced 344 fraud attempts in 2020, up 24% from the prior year. As a result, security professionals are looking at new ways to protect their services, applications, and networks from bad actors. Leveraging a variety of tools such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to stop threats quickly. Additionally, many businesses are considering the advantages of migrating from multiple security tools to a single platform that offers full visibility across their environment, with fast cyber remediation. Elastic Security provides many of the tools, best practices, and technology as recognized by Gartner . Expanding Datasets via Search Powered Solutions In a whitepaper by Deloitte , the transition to a digital & remote world, has created a widespread challenge for fraud analysts, as cases and investigations scale. The remedy for this is cited as \u2018more and better data\u2019. Capturing more intelligence can help segment subpopulations, and paint a fuller picture of behavioral patterns. Incorporating communication data (e.g. email ,video, or SMS messages) associated with transactions that can help detect fraud before any financial loss. For instance, recognizing unusual timestamps of instant messages or logs may help improve the investigation process. However, for many fraud teams, the availability and ingestion speed of critical data is limited. This can mean multiple blind spots, the inability to scale operations, or a slower time to detect incidents. Additionally, customer habits are constantly changing, making it more challenging to recognize anomalies and react quickly. Elastic helps fraud teams overcome these challenges by unifying, searching, and analyzing all data across formats, including time, space, geography, or other attributes in seconds. Unsupervised & supervised machine learning, enables fraud teams to surface the unknowns, and more precisely monitor, triage, and investigate incidents.", "name": "Catching a Fraudster: 4 modern ways technology is securing digital payments", "title": "4 modern ways to secure digital payments\u2014and catch fraudsters | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-03-30", "byline": "[Brandon Mavleos\"]", "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/modern-ways-to-secure-digital-payments-and-catch-fraudsters"}
{"body_content_window": " Hackers with little means can make a large impact The cost of entry for attacks has plummeted. We are seeing adversaries with little means make a large impact on their critical infrastructure targets, to the tune of $4.24 million average cost per breach. For instance, the hack that took down the largest fuel pipeline in the US and led to shortages across the east coast was the result of a single compromised password found on the dark web that gave hackers access to the company\u2019s VPN without multifactor authentication. Coupled with a fragile supply chain from the strains of the pandemic and a major cargo ship grounding incident, hackers are pouncing on the dynamism of a changed world. What we\u2019re learning from every cyber incident is that data is the hacker\u2019s new weapon. In order to prevent or mitigate their efforts, cyber defenders need to collect as much data of their own as possible so that it can be analyzed, acted upon, and shared as threat intelligence. With Elastic\u2019s Limitless XDR offering , which unifies security information and event management (SIEM), endpoint, and cloud security, defenders tap into detection rules, endpoint code, and other protection artifacts from millions of users within Elastic\u2019s free and open platform. These artifacts are actionable and incredibly affordable for users ranging from small business to military service branches. New users can benefit in the same way by standing up Limitless XDR in the cloud , in a matter of minutes without any hardware required. Connected or disconnected, it must be protected Ports and maritime control systems, like other critical infrastructure, lean on legacy operational technology (OT) networks and Internet of Things (IoT) devices in addition to information technology (IT), but have a limited number of staff members that specialize in the OT. It\u2019s concerning then that in 2020 alone, there were 500 major incidents targeting critical infrastructure OT. On top of that, many maritime control systems run in disconnected, intermittent, limited (DIL) environments, and do not have connectivity once they are afloat. These DIL systems may look to use low earth orbit satellites for connectivity, which introduces more complexity to the cyber footprint. Whether connected or disconnected, it\u2019s important to understand the makeup of critical infrastructure in order to protect it. Events like Hack the Port are important because they expose broader audiences to what\u2019s historically been confined to the industry itself.", "name": "What \u2018Hack the Port\u2019 made clear about critical infrastructure cybersecurity", "title": "4 lessons from \u2018Hack the Port\u2019 about 'critical infrastructure' cybersecurity | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-04-11", "byline": ["John Harmon"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/hack-the-port-security-cybersecurity-infrastructure"}
{"body_content_window": " They also provide the opportunity to discuss technology transfer, such as military-related solutions that can be applied to critical infrastructure challenges. For example, using Elastic, running machine learning models locally on DIL endpoints instead of using a malware signature-based approach enables the endpoints to remain protected, whereas traditionally, disconnected endpoints would have out-of-date signatures and be at risk. Plus, with configurable queues and distributed-by-design architecture, data and telemetry can be queued at the edge if and when network communications are down. When communications are restored, data can be seamlessly pushed from the endpoint to the cluster ensuring no data is lost due to communication issues. Cybersecurity compliance isn\u2019t busy work In her remarks at Hack the Port, Jen Easterly, the director of the Critical Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), referred to ports as a \u201csoft spot\u201d in America\u2019s critical infrastructure, and the importance of securing them cannot be understated because $5.4 trillion flows through ports each year \u2013 accounting for a quarter of the US gross domestic product. CISA provides critical infrastructure owners and operators with a great deal of threat intelligence, training, and resources, and is a leading force behind the administration\u2019s Executive Order (EO) on Improving the Nation\u2019s Cybersecurity. This EO outlines several standards and requirements that federal civilian agencies, working in partnership with the private sector, must meet in order to foster a more secure cyberspace. The EO\u2019s standards and requirements provide a strong foundation for critical infrastructure cybersecurity, whether owners or operators are bound by it or not. At Elastic, we understand that these owners and operators thrive in machinery and logistics, not necessarily in standards and requirements. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve outlined a few areas to tackle immediately to lock your digital doors using a single platform.

{"body_content_window": " Critical infrastructure owners and operators, in particular, should continually assess their cybersecurity workforce needs. Resources from organizations like the Office of Personnel Management are available to help cybersecurity stakeholders identify work roles of critical need and pinpoint the workforce\u2019s most critical skill shortages. Critical infrastructure owners and operators also need to invest in training the next generation of cyber defenders to respond to next generation cyber threats. MISI, the organization behind Hack the Port, understands this well and uses Elastic Security solutions to give diverse talent time on target with real world cyber scenarios. Elastic is also committed to connecting the dots on diversity in cybersecurity recruitment, and regularly hosts Capture the Flag events in addition to its robust training program .

{"body_content_window": " Advanced enterprise search capabilitie s, however, can eliminate blind spots and add an important layer of cybersecurity. \u201cToday, enterprises need to be able to query their environment, and they need to be able to query their data,\u201d says Katie Teitler, senior product marketer at Axonius, a cybersecurity asset management company, and former research chief at TAG Cyber. \u201cThey need the ability to have a full-stack view of what\u2019s going on in the network. Without good visibility or search capabilities, they can\u2019t identify and address vulnerabilities.\u201d That is an important advantage of modern enterprise search. They use machine learning algorithms, natural language processing (NLP) capabilities, and other tools to better understand context and meaning from a wider array of data types and formats. Here\u2019s a look at three strategies to leverage advanced search to improve security. Define search queries for security needs Effectively searching databases can help enterprises address a range of security concerns, such as risks associated with system integrations, outside attacks, and insider threats. But security teams need to identify and refine their search targets. \u201cOrganizations must contextualize security data within a business context,\u201d says Jon Oltsik, senior principal analyst and ESG fellow at Enterprise Strategy Group, an IT research and strategy firm. \u201cWhen I\u2019m investigating suspicious behavior, I may be extra diligent if this behavior takes place in business-critical applications or data,\u201d he says. To search for insider threats, Oltsik adds, security analysts \u201cneed to collect data on user access patterns so they can detect anomalous behavior.\u201d Data can help identify if an asset has a known vulnerability, and it can help identify potentially vulnerable devices on a network. \u201cI can find answers to all these questions if I have the data and I have the right query capabilities,\u201d Oltsik says. Use search to accelerate and refine threat detection Search tools can also help limit the damage of malware attacks. For example, in December 2021, a critical security vulnerability was identified in Apache Log4j, a Java tool used by countless applications for recording events into error logs. The vulnerability, called Log4Shell, allowed attackers to run malicious software , or even potentially take over, a server running Log4j. The challenge for CISOs continues to be how ubiquitous Log4j is. \u201cThere are millions of applications and services running this library,\u201d explains Mandy Andress, CISO at Elastic.", "name": "Cybersecurity is a data challenge, and better search technology is key to improving visibility and action", "title": "Cybersecurity is a data challenge, and better search technology is key to improving visibility and action | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-16", "byline": ["David Rand"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/cybersecurity-is-a-data-challenge,-and-better-search-technology-is-key-to-improving-visibility-and-action"}
{"body_content_window": " \u201cDependencies were not easily identifiable, so it was really hard to even tell if you were impacted, if you needed to upgrade, if you needed to patch, or if you didn\u2019t have any issues whatsoever.\u201d That\u2019s where robust search came into play. Elastic knew its systems and assets could be vulnerable. And by working with partners and SaaS providers, its InfoSec team was able to identify thousands of potential security holes. But were those vulnerabilities being exploited? The team then put search to work and was able to search vast amounts of data in mere seconds. A cursory search, across 60 clusters and a petabyte of data, took only 10 seconds, says Andress. A second and more targeted query, based upon those initial findings, delivered another set of results in less than a minute. In the past, that kind of searching could have taken days or even weeks \u2014 at which point additional risks would have been identified. Instead, Elastic was able to deploy patches and upgrades within a few hours. Read: Why cybsersecurity needs to be everyone's job Incorporate search into long-term security strategy Attackers have continued to probe other widely used resources. \u201cThese attackers are going for the largest targets they can,\u201d says Teitel. Existing vulnerabilities will remain risks. \u201cWe\u2019ll be seeing attacks in the future that are successful because there are unpatched and still vulnerable Log4j versions out there,\u201d Andress says. All of which makes search platforms an increasingly important tool for CISOs. \u201cYou can\u2019t just say, \u2018What\u2019s in my environment today?\u2019\u201d says Teitel. \u201cYou have to search over time: \u2018Where was I on April 1? Where am I now on May 1? Where will I be on June 1?\u201d It\u2019s all part of a game of catch-up with attackers that security teams must continue to improve on, because the volume and complexity of threats will only increase. \u201cAttackers have a lot of patience,\u201d adds Teitel. \u201cTime is on their side.\u201d Read this next: How to build and lead a data-driven organization\u2014and why it matters Share Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Facebook Share by email Print We're hiring Work for a global, distributed team where finding someone like you is just a Zoom meeting away.

{"body_content_window": " In fact, one in five organizations name EDR their biggest technology investment in two years. EDR uses machine learning to prevent ransomware and malware, detects advanced threats, and arms responders with vital context. When it comes to machine learning, this technology improves on a current gap in most organizations: Only 26% of organizations say they use advanced analytics, such as AI and ML, to identify security vulnerabilities and threats. [ Learn why Elastic was named a Strong Performer in The Forrester Wave\u2122: Endpoint Detection and Response Providers, Q2 2022 .] Meanwhile, XDR combines EDR capabilities plus machine learning-powered analytics to correlate activity and identify threats. \u201cSpeed of processing and real-time analytics are key advantages,\u201d said Andress. One in five advanced organizations plan to invest in XDR in the next two years. Interestingly in this context, one in three advanced organizations say they adopt security technologies providing a set of capabilities as a \u201cplatform\u201d as opposed to deploying point solutions. XDR is typically delivered as a unified security platform that integrates across other tools and serves as a single reference point for analysts. \"Newer XDR platforms address broader security operations with several embedded capabilities,\u201d said Andress, \u201cincluding cloud-specific out-of-the-box rules, analytics and machine learning to draw out anomalies, integrated endpoint capabilities for faster and deeper investigations, workflow integrations for response automation, and more.\u201d Plan for a future in the cloud Cloud investment grew by 25% over the past year (as a percentage of IT spending). The focus comes as organizations expand their use of cloud providers, services, and interconnections with other technologies. As organizations adopt more cloud-native technologies, they need to consider doing so securely. Nearly half of organizations (49%) anticipate misconfigurations will increase as a root cause of breaches over the next two years \u2014 more than any other root causes of their most significant recent breaches. Properly configuring security settings and frameworks on applications, systems and servers closes down opportunities for attackers to breach defenses. With this in mind, investment in cloud security is critical. Advanced organizations named cloud workload protection platforms the second most effective technology that they currently invest in, after email security. In addition, one in five organizations say they lack visibility to threats beyond the endpoint, which includes networks, cloud, and infrastructure.", "name": "How top global CISOs protect their organizations amid rising threats", "title": "How top global CISOs protect their organizations amid rising threats | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-10", "byline": ["Rajiv Raghunarayan", "Jennifer Ellard"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/how-top-global-cisos-protect-their-organizations-amid-rising-threats"}
{"body_content_window": " As more organizations expand into hybrid multi cloud environments, cloud workload protection platforms can help security teams both protect server workloads and get consistent visibility. Address security as a data challenge When it comes to threat detection and data security, there are wide margins between leaders and others. Challenges with activities like continuous monitoring, anomaly detection, and identity management suggest some organizations are struggling to get adequate visibility into their data and keep it secure. For example, while 81% of advanced organizations have managed or optimized detection processes, only 47% of others have achieved this progress. When it comes to continuous monitoring, 66% of advanced organizations ranked themselves highly, compared with 28% of others. The same goes for detecting anomalies and events, where the split is 68% of advanced organizations compared to 25% of others. The story is similar in the realm of data security. 69% of advanced organizations have managed or optimized data security, compared to 44% of others. Overall, success with identity management and access controls is relatively low: 57% of advanced organizations and only 24% of others have made progress. A significant portion of advanced organizations are improving in both these areas. As part of process initiatives in the next two years, 34% of advanced organizations plan to invest in developing and maintaining a security monitoring and threat detection capability, and 36% plan to invest in closely coordinating cybersecurity with data privacy initiatives. The latter is tied as a top process investment along with: conducting regular risk assessments, audits, stress tests, and penetration tests; and developing and maintaining a cyber incident response and recovery plan. Train and upskill your team An influx of more sophisticated threats requires a more robust and prepared team to defend against them \u2014 no small feat in an industry navigating a talent shortage. \u201cWhile the threat of malware, ransomware, and data breaches will only continue to rise, the biggest challenge in front of many security executives is finding the next generation of cybersecurity professionals,\u201d said Andress. A shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals was a current challenge for 24% of organizations, expected to increase as a challenge for 27% of organizations in two years. Advanced organizations, which tend to be larger enterprises with more employees, have larger IT and data security staffs, which can make a difference in cybersecurity preparedness. To meet the challenge, 46% of all organizations are investing in upskilling cybersecurity and IT staff.", "name": "How top global CISOs protect their organizations amid rising threats", "title": "How top global CISOs protect their organizations amid rising threats | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-10", "byline": ["Rajiv Raghunarayan", "Jennifer Ellard"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/how-top-global-cisos-protect-their-organizations-amid-rising-threats"}

Organizations predict phishing/social engineering and human error are most likely to increase as causes of breaches in the next two years, followed by ransomware. At the same time, CISOs are becoming more strategic, with greater influence over their organization\u2019s business and digital transformation plans. For instance, 42% of organizations report CISOs having greater management of customer and insider fraud. Cybersecurity is also evolving into a team effort across the C-Suite, with individuals like the CEO, COO, CIO, and legal, risk, privacy, and compliance officers seeing security as more of a strategic imperative.

It has been reported in other research as being used exclusively by APT32 (a.k.a. SeaLotus, OceanLotus, APT-C-00, G0050). Elastic Security response The Elastic Security research team identified this payload when investigating a specific cluster of Windows memory protection shellcode alerts. The alerts had unique properties attributed to a specific Microsoft signed target process. Generally, when we observe false positives for the shellcode protections, it is identified across a broad user base, and in many cases, attributed to various gaming anti-cheat or Digital Rights Management (DRM) mechanisms. In this case, a single cluster and a Microsoft signed target process was atypical of a false positive.

The power of anomaly detection is the ability to detect and provide early warning on new threat activity for which rules, indicators, or signatures are not yet available. Using ML-based anomaly detection, such as the unsupervised ML jobs in the Elastic stack, we can shrink the dwell time for this malware persistence mechanism from 46 days to less than an hour, a decrease by a factor of 1100! In most cases, if the ML models were already running when this sample was executed, an anomaly would have surfaced in as little as 16 minutes.", "name": "46 days vs. 16 minutes: Detecting emerging threats and reducing dwell time with machine learning", "title": "46 days vs. 16 minutes: Detecting emerging threats and reducing dwell time with machine learning | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-03-14", "byline": ["Security Intelligence & Analytics Team"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/46-days-vs-16-minutes-detecting-emerging-threats-and-reducing-dwell-time-with-machine-learning"}
{"body_content_window": " Let\u2019s look at a recent example. Machine learning in endpoint detection and response In this case study, ML finds a malware sample with a creation date of January 9 and a first seen date (on VirusTotal) of February 26, the same day as the Twitter discussion, a period of 46 days. At the time of this writing, none of the EDR (endpoint detection and response) products have a positive test result - a malware detection - in the VirusTotal results. Many of them report a status of \u201cunable to process this file type\u201d including Elastic. The file type is .msi, a Windows installer package file, and the differences between innocent and benign install packages may be subtle enough to make them hard to sort out in a supervised ML model. The antivirus engines are posting some detections, but only half of the antivirus engines on VirusTotal are detecting this sample, at the time of this writing, so dwell time may be ongoing for some targets. Perhaps these malware authors chose to implement the delivery system in a Windows Installer package in anticipation that they would tend to go unnoticed by many security tools. On February 26, some discussion took place about a fresh malware sample that was not yet detected. While attribution has not yet been established, at the time of this writing, there is some consensus that the sample appears to be part of a campaign targeting certain users and organizations in Ukraine. The sample took the form of a .msi file - a package format used by the Windows installer. The name of the file, qwerty.msi, is the name of a freeware utility that can view and edit msi files. Like most .msi files, this file is executed by the Windows installer in C:\\Windows\\system32\\msiexec.exe. For a malware delivery system, this is a pretty good way of blending in for a malware delivery system because the Windows Installer runs hundreds of thousands of times per day on even a small Windows fleet and may execute millions of times per day on larger fleets. On execution, the dropper creates a subdirectory named C:\\ProgramData\\.security-soft\\ and writes several files. The persistence mechanism consists of an unsigned Windows binary and a set of Lua files.", "name": "46 days vs. 16 minutes: Detecting emerging threats and reducing dwell time with machine learning", "title": "46 days vs. 16 minutes: Detecting emerging threats and reducing dwell time with machine learning | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-03-14", "byline": ["Security Intelligence & Analytics Team"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/46-days-vs-16-minutes-detecting-emerging-threats-and-reducing-dwell-time-with-machine-learning"}
{"body_content_window": " The Windows binary is named sppsvc.exe, the same name as a core Windows process, the Microsoft Software Protection Platform Service, which executes at least fourteen thousand times per day on a small Windows fleet. The C2 (command and control) server is filtering incoming connections at the time of this writing, but the sppsvc.exe process, running from C:\\ProgramData\\.security-soft\\ , attempts to open a TCP socket to destination port 80 at an IP address that resolves to a hosting provider in Lithuania. This behavior is unusual because the Software Protection Service process does not normally make outbound network calls, so this produces an anomaly detection score, created by the windows_anomalous_network_process machine learning job, which can be turned into an alert by a shipping machine learning package. Figure 1. A machine learning job detects anomalous network activity This ML job, which looks for unusual network activity by process name, was suggested by one of our user organizations who use the technique to hunt for emerging threats. It has performed well as the thesis for a machine learning job. These anomalous network events can also be turned into alerts with the corresponding alert rule Anomalous Windows Network Activity . In addition, the image loading events are unusual for this process name. The Windows Software Protection Service routinely loads two core Windows DLLs, neither of which resemble the LUA DLLs used by this persistence mechanism. These DLL (dynamically linked library) load events can also be turned into alerts with an additional machine learning job. Figure 2. A machine learning job detects anomalous DLL activity To alert on the DLL activity, we could run the rare function on the names of DLL files being loaded in image loading events. Additional anomaly detection techniques for DLLs can include a rare process or hostname for a particular DLL name. DLL image files, like executable files, are often digitally signed, and unusual image signer names may also be a useful detection. This is an area of active research and we plan to release a set of machine learning jobs for anomalous Windows DLL activity in the future. In the meantime, unusual DLLs can be found by something as simple as running the rare function on the image file name.", "name": "46 days vs. 16 minutes: Detecting emerging threats and reducing dwell time with machine learning", "title": "46 days vs. 16 minutes: Detecting emerging threats and reducing dwell time with machine learning | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-03-14", "byline": ["Security Intelligence & Analytics Team"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/46-days-vs-16-minutes-detecting-emerging-threats-and-reducing-dwell-time-with-machine-learning"}

{"body_content_window": " CVE-2022-0847 is a Linux local privilege escalation vulnerability, discovered by security researcher Max Kellermann, that takes advantage of the way the Linux kernel manages page files and named pipes allowing for the overwriting of data in read-only files. How does it work? The vulnerability can be exploited due to a flaw in the new pipe buffer structure where a flag member lacked proper initialization and could then contain a stale value. This could then be used to write to pages within the page cache behind read-only files, allowing for privilege escalation. Given the specific nature of this vulnerability, detection can be quite difficult. Elastic\u2019s research on Dirty Pipe demonstrates how the vulnerability can be detected via Auditd, what countermeasures can be used once detected, and how to respond to this exploit using Elastic Security.

As this threat continues to unfold, so will the research from Elastic on the topic. BLISTER malware campaign campaign, identified by Elastic Security The Elastic Security Intelligence and Analytics team recently uncovered the BLISTER malware campaign and delivered the first research about this campaign. Elastic researchers uncovered a novel malware loader, BLISTER, that was used to execute second-stage, in-memory malware payloads and maintain persistence during the campaign execution \u2014 leveraging valid code signing certificates to evade detection. At the time of the research being published, VirusTotal had very low or no detections active for the identified malware samples. After the research was published, VirusTotal and other security vendors began tagging actions from this malware campaign as suspicious. Beaconing malware attacks Beaconing software can be difficult to detect. Elastic researchers have recently written several articles about this type of command and control communication and how to identify it. The Elastic team recently published research about how to find and respond to Cobalt Strike beaconing attacks . Additionally, the team provided a detailed how-to article on how to find beaconing malware with Elastic . Operation Bleeding Bear Elastic research also recently verified malware attacking the Ukraine government, Operation Bleeding Bear . After the vulnerability had been identified publicly, Elastic quickly verified the evasive malware and published research to alert Elastic customers and the security industry as a whole.

These were sometimes determined by user-voted polls within the group, suggesting that this is only the beginning of a series of attacks the group is undertaking more frequently as they gain press coverage. Groups of this nature focus on data theft and extortion via means of social engineering \u2014 commonly, targeted spear phishing campaigns. The latest organization under the microscope of the LAPSUS$ group is Okta, the identity provider for thousands of companies of all sizes.

The updated notice released by Okta suggested that access was limited to a specific end-user system with no ability to create or delete users or download customer information. However, it did have the ability to reset passwords and MFA tokens for users, while not obtaining access to them.

In this blog, we will provide background on the Linux process model, a key aspect of how Linux workloads are represented. Linux follows the Unix process model from the 1970's that was augmented with the concept sessions in the 1980's judging from when the setsid() system call was introduced by early POSIX documents . The Linux process model is a good abstraction for recording computer workloads (which programs are run) and for writing rules to react to these events.", "name": "The Linux process and session model as part of security alerting and monitoring", "title": "The Linux process and session model | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-04-18", "byline": ["Mike Sample"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/linux-process-and-session-model-as-part-of-security-alerting-and-monitoring"}
{"body_content_window": " After the fork/clone, execution immediately continues in both the parent and the child (ignoring vfork() and clone()\u2019s CLONE_VFORK option), but along different code paths by virtue of the return code value from fork()/clone(). You read that correctly: one fork()/clone() system call provides a return code in two different processes! The parent receives the PID of the child as its return code, and the child receives 0 so the shared code of the parent and child can branch based on that value. There are some cloning nuances with multi-threaded parents and copy-on-write memory for efficiency that do need to be elaborated on here. The child process inherits the memory state of the parent and its open files, network sockets, and the controlling terminal, if any. Typically, the parent process will capture the PID of the child to monitor its lifecycle (see reaping above). The child process's behavior depends on the program that cloned itself (it provides an execution path to follow based on the return code from fork()). A web server such as nginx might clone itself, creating a child process to handle http connections. In cases like this, the child process does not execute a new program, but simply runs a different code path in the same program to handle http connections in this case. Recall that the return value from a clone or fork tells the child that it is the child so it can choose this code path. Interactive shell processes (e.g., one of bash, sh, fish, zsh, etc. with a controlling terminal), possibly from an ssh session, clone themselves whenever a command is entered. The child process, still running a code path from the parent/shell, does a bunch of work setting up file descriptors for IO redirection, setting the process group, and more before the code path in the child calls the execve() system call or similar to run a different program inside that process. If you type ls into your shell, it forks your shell, the setup described above is done by the shell/child and then the ls program (usually from the /usr/bin/ls file) is executed to replace the contents of that process with the machine code for ls. This article about implementing shell job control provides great insight into the inner workings of shells and process groups.", "name": "The Linux process and session model as part of security alerting and monitoring", "title": "The Linux process and session model | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-04-18", "byline": ["Mike Sample"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/linux-process-and-session-model-as-part-of-security-alerting-and-monitoring"}
{"body_content_window": " It is important to note that a process can call execve() more than once, and therefore workload capture data models must handle this as well. This means that a process can become many different programs before it exits \u2014 not just its parent process program optionally followed by one program. See the shell exec builtin command for a way to do this in a shell (i.e. replace the shell program with another in the same process). Another aspect of executing a program in a process is that some open file descriptors (those marked as close-on-exec) may be closed prior to the execution of the new program, while others may remain available to the new program. Recall that a single fork()/clone() call provides a return code in two processes, the parent and the child. The execve() system call is strange as well in that a successful execve() has no return code for success because it results in a new program execution so there's nowhere to return to except when execve() fails. Creating new sessions Linux currently creates new sessions with a single system call, setsid(), which is called by the process that becomes the new session leader. This system call is often part of the cloned child\u2019s code path run before executing another program in that process (i.e. it\u2019s planned by, and included in, the parent process\u2019s code). All processes within a session share the same SID, which is the same as the PID of the process that is called setsid(), also known as the session leader. In other words, a session leader is any process with a PID that matches its SID. The exit of the session leader process will trigger termination of its immediate children process groups. Creating new process groups Linux uses process groups to identify a group of processes working together within a session. They will all have the same SID and process group id (PGID). The PGID is the PID of the process group leader. There is no special status for the process group leader; it may exit with no effect on other members of the process group and they retain the same PGID \u2014 even though the process with that PID no longer exists.", "name": "The Linux process and session model as part of security alerting and monitoring", "title": "The Linux process and session model | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-04-18", "byline": ["Mike Sample"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/linux-process-and-session-model-as-part-of-security-alerting-and-monitoring"}
{"body_content_window": " Note that even with pid-wrap (re-use of a recently used pid on busy systems), the Linux kernel ensures the pid of an exited process group leader is not reused until all members of that process group have exited (i.e. there is no way their PGID could accidentally refer to a new process). Process groups are valuable for shell pipeline commands like: cat foo.txt | grep bar | wc -l This creates three processes for three different programs (cat, grep and wc) and connects them with pipes. Shells will create a new process group even for single program commands like ls. The purpose of process groups is to permit targeting of signals to a set of processes and to identify a set of processes \u2014 the foreground process group \u2014 that are permitted full read and write access to their session\u2019s controlling terminal, if any. In other words, control-C in your shell will send an interrupt signal to all processes in the foreground process group (the negative PGID value as the signal\u2019s pid target discriminates between the group versus the process group leader process itself). The controlling terminal association ensures that processes reading input from the terminal don\u2019t compete with each other and cause issues (terminal output may be permitted from non-foreground process groups). Users and groups As mentioned above, the init process has the user id 0 (root). Every process has an associated user and group and these may be used to restrict access to system calls and files. Users and groups have numeric ids and may have an associated name like root or ms. The root user is the superuser which may do anything, and should only be used when absolutely required for security reasons. The Linux kernel only cares about ids. Names are optional and provided for human convenience by the files /etc/passwd and /etc/group . The Name Service Switch (NSS) allows these files to be extended with users and groups from LDAP and other directories (use getent passwd if you want to see the combination of /etc/passwd and NSS-provided users). Each process may have several users and groups associated with it (real, effective, saved, and supplemental groups).

{"body_content_window": " It offers a clear representation of who did what when on which server for alerting, compliance and threat hunting. Capturing process creation, privilege escalation and lifespans offers deep insight into how applications and services are implemented and their normal patterns of program execution. Once normal execution patterns are identified, rules may be written to send alerts when anomalous execution patterns occur. Detailed process information permits very targeted rules to be written for alerts, which reduces false positives and alert fatigue. It also allows Linux sessions to be categorized as one of: autonomous services started at boot (e.g. cron) services providing remote access (e.g. sshd) i nteractive (likely human) remote access (e.g a bash terminal started via ssh) non-interactive remote access (e.g. Ansible installing software via ssh) These categorizations permit very precise rules and review. For example, one could review all interactive sessions on specific servers in a selected timeframe. This article describes how the Linux process model works and will assist in writing alerting and response rules for workload events. An understanding of the Linux process model is also an essential first step to understanding Containers and the namespaces and cgroups from which they are composed. Process model capture vs. system call logs Capturing changes to the session model in terms of new processes, new sessions, exiting processes, etc. is simpler and clearer than capturing the system calls used to enact those changes. Linux has approximately 400 system calls and does not refactor them once they are released. This approach retains a stable application binary interface (ABI), which means programs compiled to run on Linux years ago should continue to run on Linux today without rebuilding them from source code. New system calls are added to improve capabilities or security instead of refactoring existing system calls (avoids breaking the ABI). The upshot is that mapping a time ordered list of system calls and their parameters to the logical actions they perform takes a significant amount of expertise. Additionally, newer system calls, such as those of io_uring, make it possible to read and write files and sockets with no additional system calls by using memory mapped between kernel and user space. By contrast, the process model is stable (hasn't changed much since the 1970's) yet still comprehensively covers the actions taken on a system when one includes file access, networking and other logical operations.", "name": "The Linux process and session model as part of security alerting and monitoring", "title": "The Linux process and session model | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-04-18", "byline": ["Mike Sample"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/linux-process-and-session-model-as-part-of-security-alerting-and-monitoring"}
{"body_content_window": " Process formation: init is the first process after boot When the Linux kernel has started, it creates a special process called \u201cthe init process.\u201d A process embodies the execution of one or more programs. The init process always has the process id (PID) of 1 and is executed with a user id of 0 (root). Most modern Linux distributions use systemd as their init process's executable program. The job of init is to start the configured services such as databases, web servers, and remote access services such as sshd. These services are typically encapsulated within their own sessions, which simplifies starting and stopping services by grouping all processes of each service under a single session id (SID). Remote access, such as via the SSH protocol to an sshd service, will create a new Linux session for the accessing user. This session will initially execute the program the remote user requested \u2014 often an interactive shell \u2014 and the associated process(es) will all have the same SID. The mechanics of creating a process Every process, except the init process, has a single parent process. Each process has a PPID, the process id of its parent process (0/no-parent in the case of init). Reparenting can occur if a parent process exits in a way that does not also terminate the child process(es). Reparenting usually picks init as the new parent and init has special code to clean up after these adopted children when they exit. Without this adoption and clean up code, orphaned child processes would become \"zombie\" processes (no kidding!). They hang around until their parent reaps them so the parent can examine their exit code \u2014 an indicator of whether the child program completed its tasks successfully. The advent of \"containers,\" pid namespaces in particular, necessitated the ability to designate processes other than init as \"sub-reapers\" (processes willing to adopt orphaned processes). Typically sub-reapers are the first process in a container. This is done because the processes in the container cannot \"see\" processes in the ancestor pid namespaces (i.e. their PPID value would not make sense if the parent was in an ancestor pid namespace). To create a child process, the parent clones itself via the fork() or clone() system call .", "name": "The Linux process and session model as part of security alerting and monitoring", "title": "The Linux process and session model | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-04-18", "byline": ["Mike Sample"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/linux-process-and-session-model-as-part-of-security-alerting-and-monitoring"}

{"body_content_window": " A URI parameter can be passed to Tomcat as part of a standard web request to exploit this vulnerability. What is the threat? CVE-2022-22965 is a vulnerability that may affect systems on which the Spring Framework has been installed, and which expose Spring MVC or WebFlux applications running on JDK 9 or later. The exploit associated with this vulnerability requires Apache Tomcat, and that applications are deployed as Web Application Resources (WARs) \u2014 but enterprises should consider that other methods of exploitation are also possible. What is the impact? If successfully exploited, the Spring4Shell vulnerability may permit an adversary to execute arbitrary code (including malware) in the context of the web server. Because specific software, versions, and configurations are required as prerequisites, enterprises should expect a less impact than a vulnerability like Log4Shell . While Spring4Shell has more specific prerequisites to cause impact, Elastic Security still recommends following official guidance regarding patching and upgrading. Leveraging Elastic for exploit detection Prebuilt protections that generically identify aspects of successful exploitation already exist in community-facing repositories: Webshell Detection: Script Process Child of Common Web Processes Potential Shell via Web Server Additionally, Elastic provides dozens of rules for common and uncommon post-exploitation techniques, which may appear in later stages of an intrusion attempt. Artifacts Elastic\u2019s community-facing detection-rules repository contains two rules specific to webserver post-exploitation. Due to the unpredictable nature of vulnerabilities, any post-exploitation rules provided by Elastic may be helpful in detecting or understanding a Spring4Shell-related intrusion attempt. For enterprises seeking to better understand this vulnerability, consider this excellent overview by Elastic community member Stijn Holzhauer. Defensive recommendations Enterprises should follow guidance provided by Spring in their official disclosure announcement , and seek to patch or upgrade the Spring framework. Additionally, for those who may not be able to address the vulnerability in Spring, a patch has also been released to close this vulnerability in Apache Tomcat (minimum versions 10.0.20, 9.0.62, 8.5.78).

{"body_content_window": " At the time of publication these CVE IDs are still reserved. While this class of vulnerability requires local shell access to exploit, it should be considered important for those that currently leverage networkd-dispatcher within their Linux workload environments. A patch by the creator has been implemented to resolve the issue under the guidance of Microsoft, and should be implemented by those that have systems impacted by this vulnerability. Detecting Nimbuspwn activity within Elastic Our research team at Elastic has focused on building out a series of initial detections that leverage Elastic Security, alongside OSquery. Firstly, those wishing to understand what systems in their environment may be impacted need to determine systems that have networkd-dispatcher installed: Writing an OSquery search that returns the installed version of Networkd-Dispatcher is relatively trivial, and understanding the systems that may be at risk are returned at a glance. In the screenshot above, we can see an example host listed with a version number of 2.1-2, specific to Ubuntu. The version installed within your environment may be slightly different depending on the distribution. An example query has been provided below. Select version from deb_packages rpm_packages where name=\u2019networkd-dispatcher\u2019; We leveraged the initial research paper from Microsoft, determining a specific malicious pattern adversaries may use to exploit this vulnerability: The Elastic Security team wrote an EQL Detection Rule to detect suspicious child processes of Networkd-Dispatcher. Any child-process detected by this rule should be considered highly suspicious given the circumstances, and should be investigated. Further analysis will likely be provided as our security community builds more POCs for this exploit. An example query appears below: process where event.type == \"start\" and process.parent.name : \"networkd-dispatcher\" and not process.name in (\"networkctl\", \"networkd-dispatcher\") Given the nature of this exploit, we expect far greater diversity in POCs over the coming weeks. You can expect updates in the form of further signatures or rules accordingly. Defensive recommendations Organizations impacted by vulnerabilities discovered by the Microsoft team should follow guidance provided by Microsoft in their initial post, and update their instances of networkd-dispatcher. Elastic recommends investigating hosts that are found to be running vulnerable versions of network-dispatcher with the aforementioned detections for any sign of compromise.

When Cmd joined forces with Elastic Security last August, we set out on a journey to bring cloud workload runtime security capabilities that allow customers to detect, prevent and respond to attacks on their workloads \u2014- whether running on the cloud or in data centers. Now with 8.2, you get instant access to the new workload protection capabilities: Enhancing Data Collection for Cloud Workloads using eBPF: Linux is the de facto standard for highly available and reliable workloads.", "name": "Secure your cloud with Cloud Workload Protection in Elastic Security", "title": "Secure your cloud with Cloud Workload Protection in Elastic Security | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-03", "byline": ["Sneha Sachidanand"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/secure-your-cloud-with-cloud-workload-protection-in-elastic-security"}
{"body_content_window": " To protect workloads, we need an efficient way to capture runtime data from workloads. We have made additions to Endpoint Security data collection mechanisms to include eBPF . eBPF is a kernel technology that allows programs to run without modifying the kernel source code or adding additional modules, thereby making it performant and secure to run on Linux kernels. And to ensure all our users are protected, we remain compatible with a broad set of supported OSs using existing data collection mechanisms. Schema Extensions to Linux Logical Event Model: The Linux logical event model with events like fork, exec, process exit and setsid is the basic framework used to generate the data for Session View. A lot of work (detailed in this blog ) has been done to define and convert this data model to Elastic Common Schema (ECS), so it can be easily searched and indexed in Elasticsearch. This allows security practitioners to get context around what\u2019s happening in these workloads. For example, if a security alert was generated in a workload, we can dig into exactly what a user or service was doing in a session during a certain time. Investigate Workloads in a Familiar Way using Session View: Finally, the trademark feature of Cmd \u2014 Session View \u2014 is now available in Beta. Session View presents a time-ordered series of process executions in your Linux workloads, appearing like a terminal shell. It can help practitioners investigate user and service behavior on workloads. Session View is integrated into important workflows in Elastic Security, including alerting, investigation, and host exploration. This helps security analysts access rich environmental context while triaging an alert on a host. You can get additional information about each command executed like user name and arguments entered, and also information about parent process, entry leader, group leader. You can view alerts that are generated and take actions like opening a case and running an Osquery directly from Session View! Getting Started with Cloud Workload Protection With these exciting updates, I am sure you're wondering how to get started with protecting your cloud workloads. Follow these step-by-step instructions to begin. For this walk-through, I am going to use AWS EC2 instances as the workload I would like to monitor and protect. Start a Cloud Trial or upgrade your Elastic Security installation to 8.2. Once you have upgraded to Elastic Security 8.2, navigate to Integrations, then Endpoint Security.", "name": "Secure your cloud with Cloud Workload Protection in Elastic Security", "title": "Secure your cloud with Cloud Workload Protection in Elastic Security | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-03", "byline": ["Sneha Sachidanand"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/secure-your-cloud-with-cloud-workload-protection-in-elastic-security"}

Simultaneously, there are continuously motivated individuals and groups trying to utilize vulnerabilities for illicit uses such as to increase access to the data, install malware, disrupt services, and more. More recently, a series of observed threat actors have taken advantage of Shell Evasion tactics to evade detection and target unknowing victims \u2014 often to successful outcomes given the lack of visibility most organizations have within their infrastructure. Shell evasion Cybercriminals are increasingly using stealthy shells to stay undetected on their victims\u2019 computers.", "name": "Shell Evasion: An Insider Threat", "title": "Shell Evasion: An Insider Threat | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-09", "byline": ["Shashank K S"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/shell-evasion-an-insider-threat"}
{"body_content_window": " A shell evasion attack technique can be used to install malware on the target device, or circumvent controls within the system by evading the detection of rule-based engines. The term \"shell evasion\" covers the different ways that attackers can slip around security controls by using false identities. This includes using social engineering, creating false websites, and hidden passageways outside of any defensive perimeter. Shell evasion techniques are used primarily to avoid detection by anti-malware or intrusion detection systems. One risk is that an attacker can use shell evasion techniques to slip past defenses undetected and gain access to highly sensitive information. Shell evasion attacks are a method used by astute adversaries that are attempting to get around computer systems by disguising themselves as benign executables and behaviors. Research has found that some of these attacks have been using malicious shell scripts to bypass anti-malware software and avoid detection. In shell evasion, programs are often developed to execute commands from within the shell. When executed, another process can be launched in the background without the user's knowledge. This can lead to data tampering and other types of hacking that make it unclear who is behind the attack. The vulnerability of shell evasion is often increased by limitations on what commands can be executed in a restricted mode. Shell evasion attack vector There are two main types of threats that can occur with Shell execution. The first is the execution threat, where an attacker forces the victim's system to execute a malicious command or script. The other type is the insider threat, where an authorized user executes a command without realizing it could be malicious or performs an undesired (not a standard use) of the command, leading to an evasion pattern from security monitoring tools. This blog highlights the use cases of spawning interactive shells from various Linux binaries in evasive manners from regular monitoring, leading to an insider threat pattern. An example insider threat scenario can be described as when an employee has access to systems, programs, or data and maliciously uses these privileged assets. This can include things such as altering records, deleting or modifying files and programs, installing software (which may or may not be malicious, or could be unauthorized software) on the company's systems, bypassing security controls via the shell evasion technique. Preventing shell evasion Shell evasion can be easily misunderstood or misinterpreted as a shell vulnerability.", "name": "Shell Evasion: An Insider Threat", "title": "Shell Evasion: An Insider Threat | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-09", "byline": ["Shashank K S"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/shell-evasion-an-insider-threat"}
{"body_content_window": " In general, a vulnerability can always be prevented when upgraded to the patch version or by removing the use cases of the vulnerable library in the source code. It can also be prevented by temporarily suspending services that use the vulnerable library until a patch has been identified. But an evasion technique will continue to prevail if the use case is being adhered to by the library or system. The most common scenario of shell evasion is executing a Linux command outside of its expected behavior. Similar to a cpulimit command, which in normal scenarios is used to restrict CPU usage of a particular process, a Linux command is used for spawning an interactive shell with the right usage of the command. Therefore, preventing these use cases is highly unlikely, even with the best practices of secure engineering. The dimension of detecting Shell evasion takes precedence in such scenarios where prevention lies in a more idealistic way of training engineers with best practices of secure engineering. Detect shell evasions with Elastic Security 8.2 In Elastic Security 8.2 detection rules, a new category of GTFOBin shell evasion rules has been added to the platform. These rules give cloud users greater visibility in interactive shells being spawned from various Linux libraries. In the current release libraries, such as apt (including apt-get), awk, and its various forms \u2014 busybox, MySQL, ssh, and others \u2014 Linux libraries have been added to the detection rules to identify any user invoking shell via the shell evasion technique. The detection rules can be customized to fire alerts in a manner suitable for the monitored Linux infrastructure. On a newly deployed Elastic Cloud environment, navigate to the Elastic Security section and then to the Rules from the left navigation panel. There would be no rules currently in the new environment, like the below screenshot. By clicking on the \u201cLoad Elastic prebuilt detection rules\u201d, all Elastic configured rules available in this version would be now available for enabling. If the Elastic Cloud is a newly deployed environment, we can proceed to add endpoint security to this environment. Once the endpoint configuration is completed, we can proceed to add hosts. Enrolling agent is very intuitive and the steps for various OS installations are also provided. We have now successfully added a host for the environment, enabling shell evasion detection rules. Note: If there is an existing Elastic Cloud environment, please upgrade to the latest versions and then update the ruleset to the latest version, after these steps we can enable the shell evasion detection rules.", "name": "Shell Evasion: An Insider Threat", "title": "Shell Evasion: An Insider Threat | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-09", "byline": ["Shashank K S"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/shell-evasion-an-insider-threat"}
{"body_content_window": " An easy way to look for all shell evasion rules at once is to search via tags, and these rules are bundled under the GTFOBins tag. We can bulk enable all the rules at once, or a user can evaluate what suits his infrastructure best and enable only those select rules. Analyze a sample rule and check the alerting features. Scenario 1: When a shell has been evoked using the env command, Elastic Security identifies such user activities and alerts the same. The session view of the of the command execution can be visualized with details. Scenario 2: When a shell has been evoked using the apt command, Elastic Security identifies such user activities and alerts the same. We can investigate the alert in the timeline as well, for additional information. The event can be further analyzed to identify if the user is executing any malicious or unauthorized code in the spawned interactive shell via the evasion technique We can see the user has executed the date and whoami commands in the shell. Similar analysis can be provided by the sessions view. Depending on the outcome of the analysis, we can decide the closure actions for this alert using the \u2018more actions\u2019 feature in the post analysis phase.

Advanced attacker techniques, like \u201cliving off the land\u201d (LotL) that appear normal in isolation become more suspicious when observed in a parent-child context. If you are running Windows in your environment, it is important to have a system for detecting these types of attacks. Traditional heuristic-based detections, though effective in detecting a single event, often fail to generalize across a multi-step attack. At Elastic we have trained a Living off the Land classifier, anomaly detection jobs and security detection rules to help our security professionals discover LotL attacks.", "name": "Detecting Living-off-the-land attacks with new Elastic Integration", "title": "Detecting Living-off-the-land attacks with new Elastic Integration | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-11", "byline": ["Melissa Alvarez", "Apoorva Joshi", "Disha Dasgupta", "Justin Ibarra", "Craig Chamberlain"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/detecting-living-off-the-land-attacks-with-new-elastic-integration"}
{"body_content_window": " With the advent of Integration packages in the Elastic stack we can now deliver the full, customizable package that includes the LotL classification model, anomaly detection job configurations, detection rules, and inference pipelines to make it easier to install and get up and running the entire end-to-end data pipeline from collecting windows events to alerting on potential Lotl attacks. We will walk you through how we set it up so you can try it yourself. ProblemChild: Recap In an earlier blog post, we talked about how to use the detection rules repository command line interface (CLI), to set up the ProblemChild framework and get it up and running in your environment . We have now added a Living off the land (LotL) detection package to the Integrations app in Kibana. In a single click, you can install and start using the ProblemChild model and associated assets including anomaly detection configurations and detection rules. As outlined in the previous blog , ProblemChild is a framework built using the Elastic Stack to detect LotL activity. LotL attacks are generally tricky to detect, given that attackers leverage seemingly benign software already present in the target environment to fly under the radar. The lineage of processes spawned in your environment can provide a strong signal in the event of an ongoing attack. The supervised machine learning (ML) component of ProblemChild leverages process lineage information present in your Windows process event metadata to classify events as malicious or benign using Inference at the time of ingest. Anomaly detection is then applied to detect rare processes among those detected as malicious by the supervised model. Finally, detection rules alert on rare parent-child process activity as an indication of LotL attacks. The sheer volume and variety of events seen in organizations poses a challenge for detecting LotL attacks using rules and heuristics, making an ML-based framework such as ProblemChild a great solution. Getting Started We have released the model and the associated assets - including the pipelines, anomaly detection configurations, and detection rules - to the Integrations app in Kibana as of 8.0. We will be maintaining this format moving forward. If you don\u2019t have an Elastic Cloud cluster but would like to start experimenting with the released ProblemChild package, you can start a free 14-day trial of Elastic Cloud. We will now look at the steps to get ProblemChild up and running in your environment in a matter of minutes using the released Living off the land (LotL) detection package.", "name": "Detecting Living-off-the-land attacks with new Elastic Integration", "title": "Detecting Living-off-the-land attacks with new Elastic Integration | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-11", "byline": ["Melissa Alvarez", "Apoorva Joshi", "Disha Dasgupta", "Justin Ibarra", "Craig Chamberlain"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/detecting-living-off-the-land-attacks-with-new-elastic-integration"}
{"body_content_window": " Step 1: Installing the package assets In Kibana, the Integrations app now includes the LotL Attack Detection package. To install the assets, click the `Install LotL Attack Detection assets` button under the `Settings` tab. This will install all of the artifacts necessary to use the ProblemChild model to generate alerts when LotL activity is detected in your environment. Once installation is complete, you can navigate to Stack Management > Ingest Pipelines and see that the <version-number>-problem_child_ingest_pipeline has been installed and can now be used to enrich incoming ingest data. The ingest pipeline leverages the <version-number>-problem_child_inference_pipeline in order to do this. Similarly, the installed ProblemChild model can now be seen in Machine Learning > Model Management > Trained Models Step 2: Enriching your data Now you are ready to ingest your data using the ingest pipeline. This will enrich your incoming data with predictions from the machine learning model. This pipeline is designed to work with Windows process event data such as Winlogbeat data . You can add the installed ingest pipeline to an Elastic beat by adding a simple configuration setting . If you already have an ingest pipeline associated with your indices, you can use a pipeline processor to integrate the ProblemChild ingest pipeline into your existing pipeline. You should now see that the model enriches incoming Windows process events with the following fields: problemchild.prediction A value of 1 indicates that the event is predicted to be malicious and a value of \u201c0\u201d indicates that the event is predicted to be benign. problemchild. prediction_probability A value between 0 and 1 indicating the confidence of the model in its prediction. The higher the value, the higher the confidence. If you want an immediate way to test that the ingest pipeline is working as expected with your data, you can use a few sample documents with the simulate pipeline API and confirm you see the problemchild fields. Step 3: Running anomaly detection The package includes several preconfigured anomaly detection jobs. These jobs enable you to find the rarest events among those detected as malicious by the supervised model in order to decide which events require immediate attention from your analysts. To run these jobs on your enriched data, go to Machine Learning > Anomaly Detection . When you create a job using the job wizard, you should see an option to Use preconfigured jobs with a card for LotL Attacks.", "name": "Detecting Living-off-the-land attacks with new Elastic Integration", "title": "Detecting Living-off-the-land attacks with new Elastic Integration | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-11", "byline": ["Melissa Alvarez", "Apoorva Joshi", "Disha Dasgupta", "Justin Ibarra", "Craig Chamberlain"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/detecting-living-off-the-land-attacks-with-new-elastic-integration"}
{"body_content_window": " After selecting the card, you will see several preconfigured anomaly detection jobs that can be run. Note these jobs are only useful for indices that have been enriched by the ingest pipeline. Step 4: Enabling the rules To maximize the benefit of the ProblemChild framework, activate the installed detection rules. They are triggered when certain conditions for the supervised model or anomaly detection jobs are satisfied. The complete list of the installed rules can be found in the Overview page of the package itself or in the latest experimental detections release . In order to enable and use the installed rules, you can navigate to Security > Rules and select ` Load Elastic prebuild rules and timeline templates ` . Note that there are search rules as well as ML job rules. The search rules are triggered by the supervised model, for example this rule: The above rule matches on any Windows process event for which the supervised model or its blocklist has a prediction value of 1 (malicious). The ML job rules are triggered by anomalies found by the anomaly detection jobs that you set up in Step 3 \u2014 for example, this rule: The above rule is triggered each time the anomaly detection job problem_child_rare_process_by_host detects an anomaly with an anomaly score greater than or equal to 75. Summary As mentioned in the first blog post, the supervised ML component of ProblemChild is trained to predict a value of 1 (malicious) on processes or command line arguments that can be used for LotL attacks. This does not mean that everything that the supervised model predicts with a value 1 indicates LotL activity. The prediction value of 1 should be interpreted more as \u201cthis could be potentially malicious,\u201d instead of \u201cthis is definitely LotL activity.\u201d The real beauty of ProblemChild is in the anomaly detection, wherein it surfaces rare parent-child process relationships from among the events the supervised model marked as suspicious. This not only helps in reducing the number of false positives, but also helps security analysts focus on a smaller, more targeted list for triage. You could of course start with the search rules, which will alert directly on the results of the supervised model. If the number of alerts from these rules is manageable and you have the time and resources to drill into these alerts, you might not need to enable the anomaly detection jobs.", "name": "Detecting Living-off-the-land attacks with new Elastic Integration", "title": "Detecting Living-off-the-land attacks with new Elastic Integration | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-11", "byline": ["Melissa Alvarez", "Apoorva Joshi", "Disha Dasgupta", "Justin Ibarra", "Craig Chamberlain"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/detecting-living-off-the-land-attacks-with-new-elastic-integration"}

Many of the world\u2019s best security teams rely on the power of Elastic\u2019s high-speed, cloud-scale detection, prevention, and response capabilities to investigate and contain potential security threats within their environments. Many of these same teams trust Tines\u2019 no-code automation platform to optimize their mission-critical workflows, respond to attacks at speed and scale, reduce toil on analysts, and remove the friction associated with integrations.", "name": "Elastic and Tines partner to detect security threats and reduce mean time to respond", "title": "Elastic and Tines partner to detect security threats and reduce mean time to respond | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-11", "byline": ["James Spiteri"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-and-tines-partner-to-detect-security-threats-and-reduce-mean-time-to-respond"}
{"body_content_window": " By combining Elastic and Tines, security teams are able to dramatically reduce dwell times, mean time to respond, and false-positive rates while also strengthening their agility and impact. How Elastic and Tines work together Through our new partnership, SOC teams are now able to leverage the value of high-fidelity detection and alerting delivered by Elastic Security with Tines\u2019 robust automation to effectively support continuous monitoring, threat detection and prevention, alert enrichment and triage, threat hunting, incident response, and more. The visibility provided by Elastic\u2019s massively scalable approach to searching across any data source \u2014 security data, observability data, IoT data, and more \u2014 coupled with the unrivaled flexibility and intuitive interface of Tines, delivers a path to a more robust security posture that allows security teams get more power from their existing investments. Below are some sample use cases that highlight how our two platforms fit together to minimize the manual steps a security analyst needs to take. Automated alert triage, enrichment, and context Together, Elastic and Tines can provide security analysts with all of the information they need to investigate alerts and make decisions in one place \u2014 saving valuable time and resources. Customers can build automated workflows in Tines to handle Elastic alerts based on predefined criteria. Additionally, context and enrichment can be obtained and added to reduce the investigation time for analyst teams. Thanks to Elastic\u2019s rich set of APIs throughout the security solution, users can leverage Tines to trigger a workflow that creates cases, performs historical searches using timelines, attaches the relevant alerts to the case, create visualizations, and much more. Using other integrations within the same workflow, users can opt to add context from threat intelligence providers, or, perhaps, take automated action (such as lock out a user, isolate a host using Elastic\u2019s endpoint security integration, or block an IP address on a firewall after additional context or approval is obtained). More importantly, the result of these actions can also be automatically added to the case that might have been previously created. To top it off, users might decide to create a notification to let teams know that such actions have taken place \u2014 whilst linking them to the right location within Elastic\u2019s security solution.

{"body_content_window": " Comments also include results from additional API calls to Elastic and other 3rd party systems The Tines Story for the example use case above A Slack message with details of an alert triggered in Elastic Security, formatted and populated via Tines Approval and \u201chuman in the loop\u201d workflows Within most security operations teams, users have different roles, permissions, and tasks that they carry out as part of their day-to-day activities. With Elastic and Tines, it\u2019s possible to support least privilege access that still enables every team member to contribute. In this scenario, we want everyone to be able to create detection rules within Elastic Security, but they have to pass through some form of approval (such as a Slackbot, email link, etc. ), sometimes also referred to as a \u201c4 eye principle.\u201d Some members might not have permission to create rules in Elastic Security themselves, or, perhaps, they might want a second opinion from a different team or team member. Tines forms can enable these users to submit detections. The fields and values within a form can be customized to comply with the requirements for typical Elastic detections. When the form is completed, Tines can send it to an approver and use Elastic APIs to perform some additional checks in the background, making the life of the approver even easier. Once all checks are performed, and the approver is happy that the detection is relevant and efficacious for their environment, they can accept the rule to get applied within Elastic Security, or, perhaps, reject it. Example of a Tines form for this use case Message presented to the user after submitting the form Slack message sent to the \u201crule approver\u201d with details of the submitted rule Follow up message after rule was approved and submitted Resulting rule in Elastic Security These workflows are also great for allowing human interaction during an automation workflow. Earlier on, we spoke about the possibility of taking actions such as locking out users, blocking IP addresses, or isolating hosts. Whilst users might be tempted to automate these workflows end to end, it\u2019s always considered best practice to have a team member sign off on the final action as part of the automated workflow. Combining the power of Elastic and Tines allows users to achieve this with ease. To the success of our users The partnership between Elastic and Tines is an exciting one, as it brings together some of the best technical benefits in order to optimize security operations.", "name": "Elastic and Tines partner to detect security threats and reduce mean time to respond", "title": "Elastic and Tines partner to detect security threats and reduce mean time to respond | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-11", "byline": ["James Spiteri"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-and-tines-partner-to-detect-security-threats-and-reduce-mean-time-to-respond"}

But this year brings data impact to the forefront. The red team at MITRE Engenuity focused on adversary groups and techniques associated with ransomware and the destruction of data. So how did we do? During last year\u2019s evaluation, we utilized the beta version of our endpoint capabilities with Elastic Security 7.9, and provided enhanced visibility ( 80% ) for our users. This year, we used Elastic Security 7.16 (soon after our Generally Available release), which was made available in December 2021. The system was configured with standard out-of-the-box rules to detect advanced threats. This time, we increased our visibility to 90% , highlighting our rapid growth and commitment to democratizing security for every user. New Elastic Endpoint Security features including ransomware protection, memory threat protection, and malicious behavior detection were showcased in this evaluation. These features join our previously evaluated features of malware detection, SIEM detections, machine learning, and more, to provide a comprehensive detection capability.

{"body_content_window": " The faster pace and increasing risks highlight the need for IT leaders to get serious about embracing DevSecOps, a management approach that makes security a shared responsibility among development, security, and IT operations teams. One indication that DevSecOps is gaining traction in the enterprise: Nearly half of development teams used application security tools in 2020, compared to just under 30% in 2015, according to 451 Research , part of S&P Global Market Intelligence. DevSecOps is the methodology and practice of addressing security alongside both development and operations from the very beginning of the software development process. The formation of these teams fosters a shared responsibility for security, as well as a streamlined means to identify and fix vulnerabilities more quickly. DevSecOps also creates a cultural advantage for organizations: promoting knowledge sharing and an all-for-one environment in which domain experts learn from one another, says Mandy Andress, chief information security officer at Elastic. Andress has been implementing DevSecOps practices and processes since joining the company in 2018. For CISOs considering a transition to DevSecOps, here are several strategies experts recommend to guide implementation. Embrace security tasks earlier on Software engineers and security teams have historically not been close collaborators. To developers, security professionals are hell-bent on slowing the rapid pace of software launches and updates. Security pros see developers as too eager to push out code without sufficient regard for managing risk. DevSecOps was conceived, in part, to build a bridge between the two factions. One core mandate of DevSecOps is to \u201cshift left,\u201d meaning that security tasks that might have occurred later in the development cycle, or to the far right on a timeline, take place early in the design phase. Additionally, shifting left cements the cultural advantage of integrating security into every aspect of product development and deployment. Previously, security teams weren\u2019t brought in to conduct security tests \u2014 a labor-intensive task \u2014 until developers wrote their code. With DevSecOps, those teams initiate tests during early phases of development. This speeds up overall development by identifying security holes early enough to avoid forcing engineers to go back and make substantive changes. \u201cThe need for developers and everyone along the cycle to have core security skills has become essential,\u201d says Jayne Groll, CEO of the DevOps Institute, an industry group that offers training and certification programs for DevSecOps practices.", "name": "Insights: How (and why) CISOs should fast-track DevSecOps", "title": "Why it\u2019s time for more CISOs to embrace DevSecOps | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-01-14", "byline": ["Christine Kent"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-its-time-for-cisos-embrace-devsecops"}
{"body_content_window": " \u201cWe can\u2019t look at security as an afterthought anymore.\u201d The value of a high-ranking champion Like any major broad change in technology development, DevSecOps needs to be driven by a high-level executive, typically a CIO, CISO, or an engineering executive, says Bill Curtis, executive director of the Consortium for IT Software Quality . While providing access to application security tools is vital, so too is senior leadership making sure security is as great or greater priority than new features. An effective DevSecOps leader may insist teams set aside time (or even full releases) just for closing vulnerabilities as opposed to introducing new features, says Curtis. Share expertise Many developer, security, and IT operations teams need to be inspired, cajoled, or compelled to share their expertise \u2014 a challenge that people with highly technical skills can find difficult when working outside their domain. Team leaders can help, says Groll, by holding sessions so all groups understand the business impact of the other two, and making sure everyone\u2019s metrics take security into consideration. Developers will be more likely to ask their security counterparts for advice, and security teams will be more likely to give it. \u201cThe biggest obstacle to DevSecOps is as much human as it is technical,\u201d Groll says. \u201cWe have to be comfortable stepping outside of our traditional comfort zones.\u201d \u201cIt used to be that if you just got the technology right, you were good,\u201d adds Andress. \u201cToday\u2019s security teams are much more driven by empathy and an understanding of human behavior.\u201d Stay flexible There is no one-size-fits-all blueprint for implementing DevSecOps, says Andress. Rather, leaders need to set the necessary guardrails and give teams the freedom to operate within them. At Elastic, \u201cwe ask security teams to set frameworks for how security testing should operate, and make sure that developers have the right tools and processes to work in these frameworks,\u201d Andress says. \u201cThen they can work out what\u2019s best in terms of timing, and which processes to adopt.\u201d The US Navy, for example, recently launched a DevSecOps program with a process that focused on cultural rather than technical issues. The group appointed three leaders to champion the needs of products, engineers, and end users.", "name": "Insights: How (and why) CISOs should fast-track DevSecOps", "title": "Why it\u2019s time for more CISOs to embrace DevSecOps | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-01-14", "byline": ["Christine Kent"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-its-time-for-cisos-embrace-devsecops"}

CIO takeaways : Elevate the importance of organizational purpose, culture, and shared values in outreach to job prospects Be able to show progress on diversity and ESG goals in job applications and other recruitment efforts Ensure that career growth opportunities are central to ongoing job design Participants: Rashid Feroze , lead security engineer at credit-card payment platform CRED; Carmen Fontana , former software developer and current director of operations at digital healthcare firm Augment Therapy; Ivan Ninichuck , solutions engineer at Siemplify, a cybersecurity software provider; Ronnie Watson , IT security analyst in the financial services sector. What attracts you to a job and what keeps you there? Fontana: A sense of purpose. Why am I getting up every day? Am I aligned to the purpose of the company? Does it inspire me? Do I feel like I\u2019m adding value to the company? Feroze: I definitely look at the talent at a company. A company with a lot of highly talented people tends to have a great work environment. I also want to know if there is someone on the team who I can look up to and can learn from. Watson: The chance to grow, to elevate, and to learn. I want to know that there\u2019s going to be recognition for a job well done. If I do good work, I want to get a shot on other projects to try new things. Ninichuck: The main thing that attracts me to a company is that their values are in line with my own and that I see them attempting to solve real problems in cybersecurity. What are the most important factors when you consider whether or not to work at a company? Ninichuck: Leadership style. As an engineer, I don\u2019t want to be micromanaged. Once the assignment is made, let me manage how the work gets done, because then \u2014 guess what \u2014 it gets done well. The second thing I look for is a positive feeling among colleagues and some social interaction. Watson: I want to know if the company treats all of its workers equally regardless of the person\u2019s background or job title. In terms of the work environment, I like a mix of laid-back and intense work.

I also want a sense of empathy from leadership, that they see employees as humans and not machines. Fontana: With the social and political events of the past 18 months, culture has evolved from \u201cThis is a nice place to work with nice people\u201d to something more meaningful. It has become more about the DNA of the company. Companies say they care about diversity. Great, let me see your leadership team and board of directors. Are they diverse? What pipeline do you have in place so that diverse young people can rise to leadership roles? What are baseline requirements for an appealing job offer? Watson: A good salary is the baseline, but that\u2019s not the only, or most important, factor. You can always go somewhere else and find more money. It\u2019s about the opportunity for growth in the job and at the company. If I\u2019m going to be stuck at the same level after five-plus years, it\u2019s not for me. Fontana: Some things that were highly desirable before the pandemic are table stakes now. Paying to market, work from home, paid vacation time \u2014 everybody is doing these things. It becomes more about a purpose-driven company, social responsibility, and meaningful work. Feroze: Flexibility with work schedules, taking leave, or working from home. I would want a hybrid model where people can come to the office on certain days and opt to work from home on other days. Beyond that, what matters is that you share the company\u2019s values. Ninichuck: I have to believe in their product, that it addresses real security problems and solves them. The other \u201cbare minimum\u201d is that the compensation, and what I\u2019m doing in the position, matches my level of experience. What are nice-to-have perks that might tip the balance beyond salary and great benefits? Feroze: I\u2019d say employee stock-option plans. That makes every employee a shareholder. If the company does well, you do well. You\u2019re more invested in the work you\u2019re doing because you own a stake in the company. Watson: The chance to keep learning and growing with different types of projects. That could seal the deal.

I want to feel that sense of purpose and confidence in the value I\u2019m bringing to the company. Ninichuck: Freedom to create your own projects. For a historical example, look at Bell Labs. Those guys got to work on any project they wanted, in any manner they wanted. They created the transistor. They created information theory. That would be my dream at any company. Watson: A dream job would be if a Silicon Valley company working on cutting-edge security platforms wanted to relocate me and offer me room for growth. Of course, I\u2019d have to check with my wife about moving. Feroze: It\u2019s a combination of everything, from leaders with empathy to flexibility in work schedules to stock options, but most of all freedom. Personally, I would want to work in a place where I\u2019m free to experiment, free to build, free to deploy without too much need for approval from the ladder of hierarchy, and too much friction.

{"body_content_window": " I like to say that for somebody to be successful in security, they have to be obsessed with it. I\u2019m learning new skills all the time, pretty much every day, by reading the latest blogs and watching the newest YouTube tutorials by people who are respected in the community. Something fresh from a top leader in security is going to have more up-to-date information than an online course. Then you have to learn by doing. I have a full set of virtual machines and equipment where I will practice what the blog or YouTube video is teaching.

For example, in response to a new threat, they\u2019ll buy a defense product without having anyone on the Blue Team who knows how to use it. A product\u2019s not going to secure the company on its own. Either train the Blue Team so we have the skills to deploy it or hire the specialized talent who can use it out of the box. If they bring in someone with that skill, that person can bring the rest of the team up to speed by showing us how to use it on the job. That\u2019s my preference, because I\u2019m a hands-on learner. It\u2019s not about taking a multiple-choice test and getting a certificate that says, \u201cNow I have this skill.\u201d I have to get my hands on the keyboard and learn by doing. \u2014 Ronnie Watson IT security analyst in the financial services sector What is one key skill you think all CIOs should recruit for?

{"body_content_window": " To get a front-line perspective on these issues, we interviewed a group of seasoned IT pros for their insights into how enterprise leaders should approach employee training and reskilling challenges. Here are highlights from the conversations. Invest more in tomorrow\u2019s needs, not today\u2019s Sometimes leaders can be shortsighted in wanting their IT employees to only get skills that are relevant to the job they\u2019re doing at that moment. A lot of times, that\u2019s not really exciting to the employee. We want personal growth and to learn new things. For us to have vibrant careers, we have to stay ahead of the latest technologies. It\u2019s also shortsighted for the company. Even if an employee is not doing artificial intelligence at the moment, by gaining an understanding of it, they might see business opportunities for the company involving AI that allow the company to evolve. It\u2019s about gaining the skills of the future versus the skills of today. Obviously, you\u2019ve got to have a skill baseline to do your job, but leaders need to recognize that even if there\u2019s not an immediate one-to-one connection between the training and the current job, eventually it will pay off both for the employee and the company. \u2014 Carmen Fontana Software developer and director of operations at digital healthcare firm Augment Therap Reskilling employees: It takes time to master What I\u2019ve observed is that a lot of people in leadership roles expect employees to start using a specific skill set correctly immediately after taking a training course. But employees need time to delve deeper into specific topics after the training ends. They should understand that most trainings cover a lot of material, much of which might not be relevant for your work. In my career, I\u2019ve done a number of certification courses, which tend to cover topics at the surface level. It\u2019s a good introduction, but it\u2019s not enough for skills mastery. Once you are comfortable with the subject, you need to dive into certain areas yourself and find what is most relevant to your work. That means self-directed study such as blogs and YouTube tutorials, or even seeking out an expert or two directly on Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn with specific questions. \u2014Rashid Feroze Lead security engineer at credit card payment platform CRED Allow time and space for more DIY learning Managers and higher ups sometimes focus too much on certification training.

Making strides towards integrating security with the development, deployment, and monitoring of technology \u2014 in essence, protecting while observing \u2014 offers mutual benefits to developers, security teams, and the business overall. Developers, ops teams, and security analysts share a common pain point: too many tools and too little time. Whether the context is maintaining system uptime and availability or investigating suspected malicious activity on a network, DevOps and security teams need to work fast to identify issues and respond appropriately. Quickly investigating an abnormality requires data that tells a complete story of what happened. Too often, these teams need to piece together the story by manually correlating and analyzing metrics, logs, and traces, losing precious time as they struggle to find root cause and sift through disparate data from multiple tools. The ideal state for both teams is automatic correlations and advanced analytics that are easy to access from a common source \u2014 maybe a single operational store for a developer or a security information and event management management ( SIEM ) or extended detection and response ( XDR ) solution for an analyst. Imagine the potential benefits if these teams and processes were more collaborative. Observability data could add more context for security teams as they work to quickly detect and respond to threats. At the same time, developers who are cross-literate in security technology could reduce friction in development by securing from the start. Breaking down silos and simplifying workflows across DevOps and security teams may help these professionals who rely on speed reach their objectives \u2014 and those of the business \u2014 faster. Development and continued uptime of secure, reliable technology ensures an organization can continue to serve its customers.

{"body_content_window": " Finally, sometimes you may need to build a custom version of the technology stack with distributed tracing included. Eventually, you may also need to get involved with some open source projects to get the tracing your system requires. Many projects provide a way for the community to discuss and decide the future of specific implementations. For example, the Apache Kafka project is adding support for client metrics and observability, as you can see in the KIP-714 . Ultimately, it is up to you to get involved with these projects and help shape the future of the implementation. Simplifying your observability journey From a practical standpoint, adopting observability is very challenging. The reality is that most developers still feel a bit lost about the concrete steps to adopt observability. The confusion is understandable, though. Different technologies over the years, multiple approaches, proprietary products versus open-source implementations, and the twisted ideas about what observability means from vendors. For example, if you ask a vendor whose main product is focused on time-series analysis, they will say that observability is only about metrics. Another vendor whose main product is focused on collecting and storing logs will say that observability is only about logs. The same goes for vendors focused on distributed tracing. To them, it is only about traces. The reality is that observability is way more than these different types of data, also known as signal types. Individually, they have their advantages and solve specific problems. A better way to look at observability is by unifying all the signal types into one cohesive context, which unlocks the ability of an organization to answer questions about its systems and services with confidence. The so-called three pillars of observability are nothing but a fallacy. Think about pipes and not pillars. If a new signal type rises in the future, make sure to collect it and combine it with the other signal types to build datasets that will answer the questions that matter \u2014 unknown unknowns. But how to build datasets from different signal types? Pragmatically speaking, this means that signal types must be collected in a standardized way, stored using specific schemas, and live in a kind of data store that allows them to be linked to each other. This isn't easy to solve, as each signal type has its peculiarities. Metrics are time-series data that must be quickly aggregatable.", "name": "Building software reliability with distributed tracing", "title": "Building Software Reliability with Distributed Tracing | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-02-09", "byline": ["Ricardo Ferreira"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/building-software-reliability-with-distributed-tracing"}
{"body_content_window": " Ingesting metrics at scale often leads to a problem in computing called high cardinality. The logs don't have a predefined schema by themselves. Looking for data in logs requires a data store with a flexible schema, less dependent on just queries, and more about doing searches. Traces are something else entirely; they are multidimensional data with many relationships. End-to-end traces are graphs and not just trees , as a child span can have multiple parents, as well as forks. Finally, you need to be able to build visualizations on top of all these signal types so users can play with the data. When you get caught up with the semantics of solving these data problems, you quickly lose interest in adopting observability. To be fair, as any person would. But you don't need to worry about these data concerns to adopt observability. Leave this responsibility to the vendors. For example, Elastic Observability uses Elasticsearch and Kibana to handle these data problems. It is a great platform to handle signal types like metrics, logs, traces, and many others. Whereas other vendors wrote their data stores and visualization engines from scratch. This shouldn't matter to you from the observability adoption standpoint. But data collection and ingestion are still your responsibility. It is a less complex problem, but it is still a challenge. Most of the issues related to the collection and ingestion of signal types are the proliferation of different technologies. It is not uncommon to see observability data collected requiring different agents to be installed. Specific agents for metrics, others for logs, and traces make maintaining systems and keeping them up and running more challenging. Along with these many agents, data buffering and transformation technologies are commonly needed before sending the signal types to the observability backends. Technologies such as Apache Kafka , Logstash , and FluentD are recurring characters for such use cases. How does all of this complexity affect software reliability? The more tools you have to maintain every time you release a new system version, the slower and fragile your software delivery will become. It is not uncommon for developers to complain about the number of moving parts that need to be updated before a simple change occurs. For this reason, adopting observability heavily depends on how simple the implementation is.", "name": "Building software reliability with distributed tracing", "title": "Building Software Reliability with Distributed Tracing | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-02-09", "byline": ["Ricardo Ferreira"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/building-software-reliability-with-distributed-tracing"}
{"body_content_window": " Whether you focus only on distributed tracing or adopting the other signal types to develop a more comprehensive solution, simplifying your observability journey is key. Start by deciding which distributed tracing instrumentation technology you will adopt. There are many options, but each one has its advantages and disadvantages. While it is tricky to suggest one that can act as a bulletproof option, you can assume that adopting open standards should be the way to go. OpenTelemetry , which is a project created from the merger of OpenTracing and OpenCensus , is currently the best open standard to use for distributed tracing and many other observability needs, given its widespread acceptance and active community. It is also a CNCF incubating project . It supports different programming languages and ensures that the instrumentation code you write won't be wasted when you change your observability backend. OpenTelemetry also provides a standard format for signal types along with specifications. As long as you use a compatible observability backend, you don't have to worry about data plumbing to store the signal types. Here's an example of code written in Go that leverages the OpenTelemetry APIs to produce traces. func hello(writer http.ResponseWriter, request *http.Request) { ctx := request.Context() ctx, buildResp := tracer.Start(ctx, \"buildResponse\") response := buildResponse(writer) buildResp.End() // Create a custom span _, mySpan := tracer.Start(ctx, \"mySpan\") if response.isValid() { log.Print(\"The response is valid\") } mySpan.End() } Read more Listing 1 : Using the OpenTelemetry API for Go to produce traces. In this example, the function hello() belongs to a microservice written in Go that exposes an API invoked via HTTP. When this API is invoked, the microservice will execute the hello() function responsible for producing the relevant traces, as shown in Figure 6. Figure 6: Visualizing the traces produced by the microservice in Go. The complete source code of this example can be found on this GitHub repository . Keep in mind though, that the APIs and SDKs for each programming language will vary.", "name": "Building software reliability with distributed tracing", "title": "Building Software Reliability with Distributed Tracing | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-02-09", "byline": ["Ricardo Ferreira"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/building-software-reliability-with-distributed-tracing"}
{"body_content_window": " The specification may be the same but each programming language has its own peculiarities. Visit the instrumentation page on the OpenTelemetry website to find more information about the programming language of your choice. As for metrics, logs, and other signal types, the OpenTelemetry project is still in its early days. It will take a while until the community can leverage something production-ready. Meanwhile, you may need to use the tools offered by some vendors. For example, Elastic Observability has the Elastic Agent , a single, unified agent that you deploy to hosts or containers to collect data. The Elastic Agent considerably simplifies the effort necessary to collect signal types from different sources. The Elastic Agent also can be managed from a central location. This reduces the administrative overhead required to maintain your systems. Finally, the usage of cloud-managed services can considerably reduce the operational overhead required for an observability backend. Whenever possible, offloading the burden of keeping the lights on for your observability backend may be beneficial in the long run and sometimes even cheaper. After all, saving money is not just about reducing infrastructure costs. It is also about letting your developers \u2014 arguably your most expensive assets \u2014 focus on business-critical tasks. At the same time, the operation of the observability backend is done by companies that only do that. Elastic Cloud is an excellent example. With Elastic Cloud, you can benefit from having the engineers from Elastic take care of the cloud-manage service operation. At the same time, you can use Elastic Observability as a service, with the ability to deploy it in multiple cloud providers such as AWS , Azure , and Google Cloud . Starting with Elastic Observability is as easy as creating a deployment using the web console , or, to make things even more fun, creating the deployment programmatically using Terraform . Summary Reliability is the most fundamental feature of any product. After all, a system isn't beneficial if it's unavailable or nobody can use it. Building software reliability is, therefore, a constant flux of efforts focused on improving the design and operation of systems to make them more scalable, more reliable, and more efficient. Most software teams don't have the luxury of continuously focusing on optimization since innovation and delivering new features are equally important. Developing reliable software is then truly understanding what the code does from the moment it was written to when it is executed, without much room for guessing. And distributed tracing can help with this goal.", "name": "Building software reliability with distributed tracing", "title": "Building Software Reliability with Distributed Tracing | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-02-09", "byline": ["Ricardo Ferreira"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/building-software-reliability-with-distributed-tracing"}

It requires developers to look at the code, not from the perspective of what it is supposed to do but what the code is effectively doing, with little room for guessing. Distributed tracing is a technique you can use to accomplish this, and we will dive into the details for this post. Looking for the code's perfect lap One of the best things about the SRE culture is that developers become more conscious about the responsibility that lies in their hands. Instead of just writing code and building images that somebody else would use to build and deploy the system, they are responsible for overseeing the code move from pipeline to production. They need to ensure that the system is running as expected, which often means being on-call waiting for customers to complain about something. But they shouldn't need to wait until customers complain to take any action. Ford v Ferrari is an American sports drama film from 2019 directed by James Mangold that tells the history of how Ford managed to defeat Ferrari at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race in France. The plot follows a determined team of American and British engineers and designers, led by automotive designer Carroll Shelby and his British driver, Ken Miles. Although the movie is not only about him, Ken Miles was undoubtedly a vital element for the film. His character was inspired by the real Ken Miles , a British race car driver, and mechanic who became famous for his exploits within motorsports. Ken Miles\u2019 unconventional take on mechanical engineering for racing helped him win some of the biggest races in the world. There is a scene in the movie where Ken is talking with his son Peter Miles, where he\u2019s trying to explain to the boy what it takes to win a race. \"If you're going to push a piece of machinery to the limit and expect it to hold together, you have to have some sense of where that limit is. Look out there. Out there is the perfect lap. No mistakes. Every gear change, every corner. Perfect.\" The same applies to software engineering. It is somewhat impossible to get code running as expected if you have never tried the code in the right conditions that will determine if it may fail or not. After all, there's a difference between knowing the path and walking the path. When your code is executed in a staged environment, such as a unit testing platform, you assert if the code will satisfy the happy path scenarios that you hard-coded. Ultimately, this is going to assert the code's correctness.", "name": "Building software reliability with distributed tracing", "title": "Building Software Reliability with Distributed Tracing | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-02-09", "byline": ["Ricardo Ferreira"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/building-software-reliability-with-distributed-tracing"}
{"body_content_window": " Another consideration is running the code in an environment that will reflect the many possible outcomes your code may have, such as a production environment. In that scenario, you are dealing with uncertainty. Fortunately, you can transform this uncertainty into predictability with distributed tracing. By using an instrument-first approach, which is building instrumentation as you write the code for your software, you can have your code expressing its execution in a way that you can truly assess whether or not it produces the correct output. You can verify scenarios like \"will the code behave the same if it runs not in one, but several Kubernetes pods?.\" You can think about this as a complex unit test case that could answer this question, but you didn't have to write it. When your code is written along with instrumentation, you can start answering questions that may not have been asked during the system's design and implementation phases and ditch the embarrassment of not understanding your own code's behavior. You can use the production environment to debug your systems without the fear of breaking anything. Your code will be genuinely observable. But instrumenting the code alone doesn't do the magic. You also have to push your code to the limit. Pushing the code to its limits is about pursuing the unknown unknowns, instead of just known unknowns. Every release you build, every function refactored, every new dependency added, you ought to check how the code behaves along with other components, see when it breaks, and identify all the unforeseen conditions. Ultimately, your job is to look for the perfect lap. Figure 1: Timeline of a transaction instrumented using distributed tracing. Figure 1 shows an example of a code instrumented using distributed tracing. The purpose of the instrumentation is to enable rich details of what the code did when executed and provide users with a way to investigate how long it took each part of the code. The beauty of this approach is that now, you no longer have to settle with hypotheses of which path your code may have taken. You now have a picture of the execution of your code. If code instrumentation is so great, why do developers avoid it as much as they can? You may ask. Presumably, code instrumentation is terrible for performance, and leaving the code with the instrumentation written in it will slow things down. It is essential to know a few things. First off, code instrumentation has evolved a lot in terms of performance overhead. The perception of being something slow came from technologies from the past.", "name": "Building software reliability with distributed tracing", "title": "Building Software Reliability with Distributed Tracing | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-02-09", "byline": ["Ricardo Ferreira"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/building-software-reliability-with-distributed-tracing"}
{"body_content_window": " Furthermore, it can be disabled at any time via configuration. Therefore, developers no longer have to fear the performance impact of code instrumentation and perhaps the potential refactoring they would have to implement to remove the instrumentation from the code to fix the problem. You can leave the code untouched and disable the instrumentation as needed. Hopefully, knowing this trick may encourage developers to adopt an instrument-first approach during development. In fact, leaving the instrumentation on your code provides extra superpowers! Code Instrumentation allows you to compare different releases from your system and the changes that may have affected performance, availability, and correctness. Since distributed tracing allows you to have a picture of the execution of your code, you can now compare the picture of each release and quickly see if, for example, the last committed code pushed on a Friday night broke anything. To illustrate this, let's say that after the last release, you started to have customers complaining about the performance of a transaction that usually takes less than a second to complete. You can use your observability backend to inspect the transactions done before the last release and check its execution, as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2: Investigating the performance of a business transaction in a previous release. Then, you can fast forward in time to inspect the transactions executed after the last release and compare the differences. As you can see in Figure 3, the last release introduced a new step called additionalMarkUp in the transaction, which increased its overall execution time significantly to more than five seconds. Figure 3: Investigating the performance of a business transaction in the last release. This troubleshooting style is perfectly possible as long as the observability backend provides longer retention for the ingested traces, as you need to compare current data with past data. For example, with Elastic Observability , you have the concept of Searchable snapshots , where you can configure its persistence layer to handle more data density for historical data, using cheaper storage such as Amazon S3 , Azure Blob Storage , and Google Cloud Storage . You can store more data without skyrocketing your storage costs. But observability is not just about debugging your code. The real value from observability comes when you use it to figure out where exactly in the system to look for code that needs debugging. You can achieve this superpower by adopting an instrument-first approach, where your code can become genuinely observable.", "name": "Building software reliability with distributed tracing", "title": "Building Software Reliability with Distributed Tracing | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-02-09", "byline": ["Ricardo Ferreira"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/building-software-reliability-with-distributed-tracing"}
{"body_content_window": " What does it take to embrace the instrument-first approach? Well, you can start by learning how instrumentation works for the programming language used to build your services. Then, you can apply code instrumentation to the parts of code that are relevant to your customers. Suppose you are designing an e-commerce system that allows customers to browse for products, put those products into a shopping cart, provide a way to pay for them, and, once paid, handle product shipment. This flow is what is relevant to your customers. In this case, this whole customer flow \u2014 also known as a business transaction \u2014 should be explicitly observable via distributed tracing. Remember, though, distributed tracing is not a goal achieved overnight. The most successful observability implementations result from several iterations, where each step instruments another aspect of the code for the sake of tracing. In the first release of your software, you may not have noticed that a particular dependency is essential to the success of a given business transaction. You can ensure that the dependency is included in the next release, given its importance. Knowing that you have an iterative process is important to remove the burden from your shoulders about expecting a perfect, distributed tracing implementation in your first attempt. It is OK to be incomplete. Distributed tracing is not a single-shot type of implementation. It is an ongoing, always incomplete, constant code refinement that developers must consider. If your code is still under development and changing, the same goes for your distributed tracing implementation. Remember, your code's perfect lap is out there. No mistakes. Every new release you build, every function refactored, every new dependency added. Perfect. Four golden signals, one perspective \"You can't manage what you don't measure.\" This iconic statement is one of the most famous quotes found in books about business management. It\u2019s also become well-known among folks responsible for maintaining systems online, such as SREs. As an SRE, you can't say that you manage a system if you don\u2019t have a single clue about its current state. The best way to assess the system's current state is to continuously probe for data and build up metrics around it. Metrics can be used to evaluate how the system is going, which way it may be trending, and build knowledge about the system's behavior given past incidents.", "name": "Building software reliability with distributed tracing", "title": "Building Software Reliability with Distributed Tracing | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-02-09", "byline": ["Ricardo Ferreira"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/building-software-reliability-with-distributed-tracing"}
{"body_content_window": " For example, you can investigate a past incident where your system was unavailable for thirty minutes and create a causation analysis that demonstrates that when it happened, the database's CPU spiked during the same time interval. This is known as monitoring, a practice that has been around for quite some time now. But the technologies used to implement it have matured significantly in the last few years, especially in the areas of time-series analysis and storage. Without monitoring, managing your system will be like driving a car with your eyes blindfolded \u2014 it will be only a matter of time before an accident happens. With monitoring correctly in place, the monitored system can be protected by having a human alerted when one of the metrics is problematic. Successful monitoring is in the end, a matter of which metrics you decide to collect. Luckily, there\u2019s no need to guess about which metrics to collect. Some lessons learned in SRE can provide you with a relatively great start. One key learning is regarding the four golden signals . They represent the aspects of a system that really matter the most. Focusing on the aspects that matter the most is important as metric collection doesn't come for free. Collecting metrics always incur a slight overhead, whether in the source system where you pulled those metrics or storing the metrics. But, you have to start somewhere, and the four golden signals are a great starting point. Latency : The time it takes to service a request, which includes the monitoring of all successful or errored requests. Latency must be measured from individual services, collection of services, and end-to-end business transactions. Traffic : How much demand is being placed on your system, measured in a high-level system-specific metric. For example, this metric may be the number of transactions per second for a key-value storage system. Errors : The rate at which your services are failing. They can be explicit like the number of HTTP 500s, implicit, like the number of HTTP 200s with errors, or derived by policies like whatever requests don't complete in one second is considered an error. Saturation : How \"full\" your service is. This can be measured in various ways, such as how much more load the system can handle and given a set of constrained resources \u2014 when approximately it will stop serving requests. By focusing on the four golden signals, you can better assess the system's current state and what to do next. It\u2019s an excellent first step to achieving software reliability.", "name": "Building software reliability with distributed tracing", "title": "Building Software Reliability with Distributed Tracing | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-02-09", "byline": ["Ricardo Ferreira"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/building-software-reliability-with-distributed-tracing"}
{"body_content_window": " But it is not the only step. Previously, we discussed the concept of a business transaction. This is what customers see as most relevant. More important than monitoring the four golden signals from the system's perspective is monitoring the four golden signals from your customer's perspective. After all, \"nines don't matter if users aren't happy.\" This quote was coined by Charity Majors , where she explains that you may have a highly available system with five-nines of availability, and customers could still not finish their transactions. Here\u2019s where distributed tracing can truly bring value to your journey in building reliability for your software. Yes, keep an eye on the four golden signals, but let distributed tracing glue them together and help you understand the customer's business transactions. Don't just monitor the latency of your microservices. Instead, observe how their latencies affect a given business transaction. You can accomplish this by instrumenting your code with distributed tracing, which will act as a catalyst in unifying collected metrics with executed code. Figure 4 is a great example of this. Given a business transaction, you can see how the four golden signals can be visualized in the context of that transaction. This visualization is provided automatically. All you need to do is instrument the code and ingest the produced traces to the same backend where metrics are being stored; in this example, we have Elastic Observability , which can automatically correlate the traces and the metrics. Figure 4: Visualizing the four golden signals from the perspective of a transaction. When you focus on your customer's perspectives, you will rarely be caught by surprise if your systems start to fail for whatever reason. Thanks to distributed tracing, you can act upon what\u2019s causing the issue, which it will efficiently point out. Then you can work towards building a fix as soon as possible. Without the customer perspective, you will be stuck forever in that war room trying to convince people that everything is okay because a given metric shows up as green \u2014 but everybody else will argue that nothing is working and you should do something about it. Let\u2019s call this the four golden signals, one perspective. This one perspective is the business transaction that your customers will be interacting with. It is the only perspective that really matters. The four golden signals must be derived from that perspective so that discussing them should always be in the context of a given business transaction.", "name": "Building software reliability with distributed tracing", "title": "Building Software Reliability with Distributed Tracing | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-02-09", "byline": ["Ricardo Ferreira"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/building-software-reliability-with-distributed-tracing"}
{"body_content_window": " This model resembles the \"4+1\" architecture view model from Philippe Kruchten . The idea is that the other aspects of the system are considered from the perspective of the system's user and the use cases around it. It is a proven way to ensure that all stakeholders are on the same page and energy will be focused on what matters. We're not in Kansas anymore The way developers build systems has changed significantly over the years. It is possible to observe this by looking at the evolution of distributed tracing. Its origins go back to 2002 with a prototype called Pinpoint developed by researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, and Stanford. Its goal was to identify the root causes of problems in internet services created using J2EE. All traces were based on single-machine requests and the context was stored in thread-local variables within the JVM. After this step forward in J2EE, researchers at Microsoft Research Cambridge developed Magpie in 2004, a project focused on recording detailed end-to-end traces and annotating those traces with fine-grained information, focused on .NET-based systems. A bit more ambitious than Pinpoint, Magpie wanted to provide tracing for heterogeneous environments; however, they ended up relying on Microsoft's specific components, such as the Windows XP's event tracing for Windows, making it hard to use other platforms. As you can see, they both solved the problem of handling traces using inferences available on individual technology stacks. A reasonable expectation, given that at the time, most systems were created using a single technology stack and executed in a few, known by name, servers. In 2007, the University of California developed another project called X-Trace. Its purpose was to implement request tracing between distributed systems running on different computers. To accomplish this goal, the X-Trace project proposed a standardized way of propagating the trace context, so the distributed trace could be constructed with a more deterministic approach and be less dependent on specific technology stacks. In 2010, Google developed an internal system called Dapper, which was heavily inspired by Pinpoint, Magpie, and X-Trace, but focused on solving some operational problems found while using these projects at scale in production systems: the need for trace sampling, trade-offs surrounding runtime overheads, data security, and how to make traces accessible to users. At this point in time, we can agree that the world had already embraced the idea that distributed applications were a new reality.", "name": "Building software reliability with distributed tracing", "title": "Building Software Reliability with Distributed Tracing | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-02-09", "byline": ["Ricardo Ferreira"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/building-software-reliability-with-distributed-tracing"}
{"body_content_window": " From 2002 to 2010, there was an apparent revolution in how systems were built and how the world started to shift from monolith applications to distributed systems that communicate via APIs. All the work done in the distributed tracing space was ultimately, a reaction to the needs of developers. Business transactions were executed by code written in different programming languages, running on different machines, running with different runtimes, and sharing data over remote procedure calls. However, it may be worth detailing another change in the last decade. Since 2010, there has been another shift in how systems are built. We are currently in an era of highly distributed and deep systems. Yes, systems still communicate via APIs and share data over remote procedure calls. But JSON and XML are no longer the most popular data formats used, with binary technologies like Avro, Protobuf, and Parquet getting mainstream. Streaming systems such as Apache Kafka, Pulsar, and Flink are no longer only themes of specialized tech conferences for developers. Data flows implemented using Hadoop, Spark, and TensorFlow are the new mandate for complex artificial intelligence use cases. Bare metal hosts were replaced by VMs, which gave place to containers, and functions are getting popular as a unit of code deployment. As Dorothy commented in The Wizard of Oz, we're not in Kansas anymore. For instance, OLTP and OLAP systems were always different things in the past. Traditionally, developers would only implement data pipelines to offload transactional databases and run analytics workloads using specialized data warehouses. Data engineering has evolved from a niche data analytics skillset to a standard developers' expertise. Modern systems often rely on data pipelines for their backend and frontend layers. When they are executed, most business transactions leverage data served by these data pipelines. Therefore, data pipelines are now part of the standard business transaction, even though they are not directly part of the critical transaction path. How can we debug systems using this design? How can developers understand a business transaction if the flow is broken down into different contexts? These are questions developers ask themselves, and it is hard to build software reliability without answers. Distributed tracing still helps with this \u2014 but there is now a shared responsibility between developers and what distributed tracing can deliver. For starters, context propagation sometimes may not happen automatically. Developers may have to roll up their sleeves and write code to make this happen.", "name": "Building software reliability with distributed tracing", "title": "Building Software Reliability with Distributed Tracing | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-02-09", "byline": ["Ricardo Ferreira"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/building-software-reliability-with-distributed-tracing"}
{"body_content_window": " For example, think about a flow where a transaction starts in one microservice written in Java that reads data from Redis and then publishes a message to Apache Pulsar . From the Java microservice perspective, the transaction has finished. But from the business transaction perspective, it is still pending. Other microservice written in Go will give continuity by reading the message off Pulsar and resuming the processing. The challenge is that the business transaction flow is broken down into different processes executed asynchronously. Modern observability technologies such as OpenTelemetry provide the tools, APIs, and SDKs for developers to handle scenarios like this. It is a solved problem. Yet, it requires developers to explicitly use them in their code, which is sometimes unpleasant. The unpleasantry comes from developers having to write extra code to solve a problem they didn't know they would have until they needed distributed tracing. The session Building Observable Streaming Systems with OpenTelemetry , which was presented on Berlin Buzzwords in 2021 , shows an example of this scenario and how to implement context propagation manually. Figure 5: Example of transaction whose context was propagated manually. Furthermore, you may also have to understand how specific technology stacks will create their own traces. This is important because developers are increasingly using technology stacks to build up the layers of their systems. Service meshes are a good example. If you deploy a service mesh such as Istio with your system, this means that the service mesh will manage all the interprocess communication; therefore, you need to make sure that interactions will emit a trace so you can have visibility across the transactions. The same goes for Kubernetes. If your system connects to a database running in Kubernetes, you need to ensure that this interaction will also emit a relevant trace. So you need to configure your Kubernetes cluster accordingly. To build this level of tracing, you will need to understand in further detail how each technology stack provides you with extension points. Sometimes it is as easy as configuring their support for a particular distributed tracing technology. Sometimes, you may need to leverage the built-in plugin architecture and write an extension. For example, this Jenkins plugin allows developers to monitor your pipelines using OpenTelemetry.

We monitored this reduction through subsequent upgrades and noticed its impact on our data transfer and storage costs. So here it is: upgrading saved Elastic $3,500 per day, or approximately $100,000 a month, or $1.2 million annually. We are excited to see these innovations directly lower the total cost of ownership and potentially save money for our customers. Here's a closer look at how we did it, and how you can, too.", "name": "How we saved $100,000 a month just by upgrading to the latest release", "title": "Elastic on Elastic: How we saved $100,000/month by keeping our own software up to date | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-04-27", "byline": ["George Kobar"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-observability-clusters-upgrade-latest-release-save-money"}
{"body_content_window": " Note: As of the date of this blog post, the latest Elastic release is 8.1 \u2014 however rest assured that if you're upgrading to the latest release, you're getting the data (and cost) savings present in 7.15, along with all the efficiencies and improvements we've since introduced. Introducing Elastic\u2019s own observability (O11y) clusters Observing production software, services, and infrastructure is critical to the success of any organization. That is why at Elastic, we use Elastic Observability to ensure the availability of Elastic Cloud . Not only do our customers depend on this managed service for their observability, security , and search , but we also use Elastic Cloud for these same use cases. All told, Elastic\u2019s observability cluster comprises approximately 207 production clusters spanning 4 different cloud providers, hosting over 1.2 trillion documents. The 207 clusters can be broken up into 3 clusters in each cloud region , where we gather, store, and analyze data like metrics, logs, and APM data. While this provides the benefits of restricting network traffic to regions and for isolation and security, it can be challenging to recognize patterns across a distributed platform. If there is an interesting data point in one region, how can you easily determine if the same data point is occurring in any of our other regions? By applying cross-cluster search , the Elastic Cloud Observability team uses a single overview cluster that executes searches across all of the regional logging, metrics, and traces clusters. Cross-cluster search is both a scalable and seamless solution to keep up with the pace of Elastic Cloud\u2019s regional expansion as our team monitors each new region. If you would like to know about our single overview cluster, you can read about it here . Or if you are curious about how we defined our SLI/SLO parameters for Elastic Cloud, you can check this ElasticON talk here . Avoiding a network traffic jam With the size and scale of the observability cluster monitoring Elastic Cloud, there is bound to be \u201csome\u201d network traffic. Other than the terabyte of logs, metrics, and trace data ingested per day, there is also roughly 464TB worth of inter-node traffic! This includes data being relocated between tiers defined by index lifecycle management (ILM) and data sync between nodes that are located in different availability zones to ensure high availability.", "name": "How we saved $100,000 a month just by upgrading to the latest release", "title": "Elastic on Elastic: How we saved $100,000/month by keeping our own software up to date | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-04-27", "byline": ["George Kobar"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-observability-clusters-upgrade-latest-release-save-money"}
{"body_content_window": " Searches that are executed across multiple nodes of a cluster from the overview cluster also contribute to this network traffic. If you are familiar with the pricing from some of the major cloud providers, then you already know how data transfer and storage (DTS) network traffic charges can quickly add up. With the enhancements made in Elasticsearch 7.15 , inter-node traffic was reduced by more than half to 204.5TB \u2014 and with this significant reduction in DTS saved Elastic more than $3,500 dollars a day, $100,000 per month, or $1.2 million a year! How we did it In Elasticsearch 7.15 there were two critical changes to drastically reduce DTS: 1. Network data compression The first change was utilizing lz4, a lossless compression algorithm we used to compress indexing data. From our benchmarks shown below, we show negligible performance overhead for heavy-indexing use cases like logs, metrics, and time-series data while reducing inter-node traffic by more than 70%. This greatly reduced node traffic which helped ultimately reduced our DTS cost. 2. New data relocation and recovery methods Prior to 7.15, data relocation between phases in ILM like hot and warm could be sent to different data nodes within the cluster. If nodes are located in different availability zones then a cost would be incurred for sending network data from node to node from the cloud provider. In 7.15, data relocation is handled by utilizing snapshot data. Communication between the data nodes and the snapshot storage doesn\u2019t traverse different availability zones which reduces DTS costs. In addition to data relocation, automatic shard recovery and resilience are improved by using snapshot data. Prior to 7.15 if a data node is added, replaced, removed, or simply unreachable, copies of data would be rebalanced across the remaining data nodes within the cluster to ensure resiliency. Shards would be copied from node to node via inter-node communication which would increase DTS. Using the same technology, 7.15 shards are now recovered from snapshot data stored on cloud object storage, avoiding communication from node to node that would otherwise increase DTS. If you would like to know more about these changes in 7.15 and DTS reduction, I would highly recommend reading reducing data transfer and storage DTS costs in Elastic Cloud.

This is particularly true for telecom providers who have pumped billions of dollars in building 5G networks. The telecom cloud market is expected to cross USD 74 billion by 2026. So, this presents telecom-as-a-service (TaaS) as an opportunity for telecom providers to monetize their network assets as well as decades of expertise in building and managing network infrastructure. In this blog post, we take a broader look into some widely acknowledged 5G monetization opportunities and explore why unified observability is a prerequisite.", "name": "How can observability help telecom providers accelerate 5G monetization?", "title": "How can observability help telecom providers accelerate 5G monetization | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-18", "byline": ["Suranjeeta Choudhury"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/how-can-observability-help-telecom-providers-accelerate-5G-monetization"}
{"body_content_window": " New opportunities on the horizon Network slicing in 5G arguably presents one of the biggest monetization opportunities for telecom providers, estimated at USD 200 billion. As the GSMA article rightly puts it, network slicing enables telecom providers to deliver connectivity and data services tailored to customers\u2019 specific requirements. So, a successful implementation of network slicing will need much more than traditional network monitoring . Telecom providers will need data from multiple network layers, performance and quality metrics, geolocation details, business and operational support system data such as billing and charging, customer demand and behavior analytics, and even information on ecosystem readiness. The ability to derive meaningful insights from these disparate data silos to drive decision making at all levels, including real-time and near real-time application and service management, will differentiate a telecom provider\u2019s capabilities in delivering services using network slicing. An IDC study estimated that the number of IoT-connected devices will cross 55 billion by 2025, producing data in excess of 79 zettabytes (1 ZB = 1 billion TB) of data. This brings us to our second 5G monetization opportunity, the Network Data Analytics Functions (NWDAF). NWDAF is a 3GPP method to standardize data collection and management from user equipment (UE), network functions, and various network operations and maintenance systems. When NWDAF was introduced in 3GPP Release 15, it received lackluster attention owing to the lack of data and clarity for a standardized 5G network performance management approach. However, the growing complexity of 5G networks and massive volume of machine generated data have made automation in network management inevitable. This is where NWDAF comes in. With a standard approach, telecom providers can automate much of 5G network management while focussing on innovation and enabling new 5G services. While B2C customers are willing to pay a premium for differentiated experiences such as gaming or on-demand streaming, enterprises are keen on tapping new revenue streams. So, telecom providers have an opportunity to package NWDAF with a much wider set of capabilities tailored for specific use cases. As 5G networks expand to the cloud, telecom providers can tap into TaaS, reducing total cost of ownership and opening new revenue streams in the process. They can explore new managed network services for software defined wide area networks, provide network access in the cloud, or even help set up private networks on-prem for enterprise customers across manufacturing, healthcare, and many other industries.", "name": "How can observability help telecom providers accelerate 5G monetization?", "title": "How can observability help telecom providers accelerate 5G monetization | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-18", "byline": ["Suranjeeta Choudhury"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/how-can-observability-help-telecom-providers-accelerate-5G-monetization"}
{"body_content_window": " Reimagine telecom with unified observability By now, it is evident that finding an effective data strategy, that breaks down silos, is key to 5G monetization. Telecom providers have a significant advantage given their role as guardians to a wealth of data. So, what\u2019s slowing down the opportunity engine? A recent KPMG study shows that underutilization of data resources continues to be a major hurdle for telecom companies. Only 32% fully utilize customer data while less than 10% rate their level of maturity as world class when it comes to data monetization. With an observability led data strategy , telecom providers can seek insights that would otherwise be impossible to put in perspective. So, whether it is usage insights, customer behavior, signaling KPIs, mobility data, network security, performance metrics from the IP network, radio, or RAN, end-to-end observability can help telecom providers to make informed choices on their investments. They can make data-led decisions when identifying use cases for quicker ROI, optimize network performance for quality-of-service guarantees, and drive efficiency in business and operational support systems. Security is a critical piece of the 5G monetization puzzle. We cannot talk about security in isolation though because observability and security are two sides of the same coin. A unified observability approach is essential in knowing about everything that\u2019s happening in the network in real time, including cyber threats, malicious activities, or any kind of anomalies. This makes way for the DevSecOps continuum as insights from the network are fed constantly into the development and operation cycles, integrating security measures, and making them tighter. With advanced machine learning (ML), many of the security rules can be automated which not only reduces the risk of human error, but also enables compliance monitoring. The advantages of using ML for intelligent automation extend well beyond security into automated resource management, network slice sizing, lifecycle management of slices, and miscellaneous performance and configuration management tasks, to name a few. Looking ahead Challenges with data formats (structured and unstructured), data silos, and data modernization have continued to act as major deterrents in ramping 5G monetization efforts. With exponential growth in data from 5G networks, telecom providers will need to address these challenges today.", "name": "How can observability help telecom providers accelerate 5G monetization?", "title": "How can observability help telecom providers accelerate 5G monetization | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-18", "byline": ["Suranjeeta Choudhury"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/how-can-observability-help-telecom-providers-accelerate-5G-monetization"}

Developers are using application security tools nearly as much as security specialists, according to analysis from 451 Research, part of S&P Global Market Intelligence. Meanwhile, Forrester Research recently forecast that security specialists will begin to adopt observability capabilities, a practice very familiar to developers. How will this change the way organizations are designed and work? Here are three predictions for DevSecOps\u2013and how to harness their potential. 1.", "name": "What\u2019s the future of DevSecOps? 3 predictions on how IT Ops and Security are changing", "title": "What\u2019s the future of DevSecOps? 3 predictions on how IT Ops and Security are changing | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-03-16", "byline": ["Megan Radogna"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/whats-the-future-of-devsecops-3-predictions-on-how-it-ops-and-security-are-changing"}
{"body_content_window": " Security will find untapped potential in observability data In reality, observability data might live in a separate system that isn\u2019t top of mind or as easy to access for security analysts . But imagine if DevOps and security teams could both make use of observability data. Through correlated logs and traces, observability data could augment investigations and improve the experience for SREs and security analysts as they manage alert fatigue. Observability solutions could also offer managed security service providers a lens into mean time to respond (MTTR) data. Another result could be increased visibility over data, which enables incident response . As 451 Research points out, \u201cThe monitoring data that organizations depend on to assure the performance and availability of modern technology \u2013 encompassed in the concept of \u2018IT observability\u2019 \u2013 increasingly represents a source of data directly relevant to securing the organization.\u201d 2. Expertise will become increasingly integrated across teams The way IT decision makers have been assigning tools across DevOps and security teams is telling, as suggested earlier by data from 451 Research . In 2015, there was a wide disparity in tool assignment, with 29% of developer teams and 71% of security teams using application security tools. By 2020, the margin had closed: 48% of developer teams and 52% of security teams used application security tools. The data highlights that security is no longer the sole provenance of security teams, and hasn\u2019t been for some time. Developers will need to continue building the expertise to remediate exposures without impact on critical functionality. To that end, security professionals will be expected to be literate in the tools and processes required for rapid development and deployment of technology. DevOps and security teams will need to develop enough cross-literacy in each others\u2019 functions to collaborate in ways that promote a strong security posture without impeding development. 3. Executives will set the tone from the top down DevOps and security both tie back to the bottom line for organizations. Reliable products generate more revenue and efficient operations control costs. Preventing a data breach mitigates damages and recovery costs that can total into the millions. The two practices seem to naturally go hand-in-hand \u2013 and it\u2019s up to IT leaders to make this business case to their organizations.

One hot topic in DevOps communities is observability. A long word, you may be wondering what it really means and how you can add it to your skillset. Here\u2019s a quick primer to get you going on your path to observability. Where did the term \u201cobservability\u201d come from? The concept of observability dates back to the mid-20th century, where it was originally used in control theory to describe how the internal states of a system can be inferred from knowledge of the system\u2019s external outputs.", "name": "A primer to understanding observability", "title": "A primer to understanding observability | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-04-04", "byline": ["Jamie Smith", "Ron Wen"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/primer-to-understanding-observability-elastic"}
{"body_content_window": " An observability solution can help you extract even more information from your telemetry data (metrics, logs, traces) \u2014 allowing you not only to see the internal state of your distributed systems, but also help you uncover the unknown unknowns : the things that may be going wrong that you didn't even know to look for. By adding metadata to your metrics, logs and traces, you can now understand the context of those data points and issues relative to an application or user transaction. As an example, imagine a process with an order processing system: transactions are failing, but not every transaction, making debugging extremely challenging. If you are monitoring the right metrics, it might be able to show that something is wrong and even alert you. However, the notification of a problem is only possible if the metrics are being monitored and violate a threshold, which is highly unlikely in case of intermittent problems. In such cases, when users complain, often there is little in terms of investigation that can be done. Since observability has all the telemetry data, operations teams can ask questions, which would let the correlate issues and find that globally, only people checking out using British pounds to pay are having trouble. This operational insight then leads directly to identifying issues with the currency API. Investing in an observability initiative allows you to intelligently troubleshoot, diagnose, and correlate application issues in an end-to-end manner, no matter how complex your application environment. And even take a look back at how an application performed in the past versus where it is today. The overall goal? The ability to analyze all your telemetry data for interactive investigations and actionable insights. How do logs and metrics work within observability? Capturing and storing logs and metrics is often the first step towards observability and also for basic monitoring. Metrics and logs allow you to measure the performance of infrastructure (CPU, memory, I/O metrics) and application technologies in your environment, in near real-time for interactive investigation. All of your logging and metrics data is also observability data and you will need to store it at the right granularity along with additional contextual information in a common data store and common schema to get you to observability. It is important to consider high cardinality and high dimensionality for it to be meaningful for observability.", "name": "A primer to understanding observability", "title": "A primer to understanding observability | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-04-04", "byline": ["Jamie Smith", "Ron Wen"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/primer-to-understanding-observability-elastic"}
{"body_content_window": " You absolutely need logging and metrics data for any observability initiatives but they alone are not sufficient for today\u2019s modern, cloud native applications whether on AWS , Azure , or Google Cloud . What do application performance monitoring (APM) and distributed tracing add to observability? While logs and metrics provide some visibility, adding distributed traces as part of your observability initiative, expands your diagnostic toolbox. Application performance monitoring via distributed traces helps you stitch together your transactions into a logical collection (using metadata) representing user journey through the services or application. A great start to ensuring a predictable customer experience. Through instrumentation of your applications and services, you can now tag and track your telemetry data with custom metadata to assist debugging and troubleshooting. Distributed traces and APM helps you understand where there may be bottlenecks or performance issues within an application, or from the user\u2019s perspective, an online transaction. The addition of machine learning and AIOps will even allow you to automatically surface anomalies and potential issues to truly optimize your applications. While APM and distributed traces can help you within a transaction or application, observability broadens the scope further by giving you visibility across your ENTIRE application ecosystem. This helps you understand the impact across applications and services given the complexity of today's distributed software architectures and ephemeral cloud environments that rely on (potentially oversubscribed) shared resources (storage, compute, memory, microservices, serverless functions). What kind of telemetry data is needed for an observability initiative? For your observability solution to be effective, you need to collect as much data as possible with high dimensionality and cardinality \u2014 you can't answer the questions if you don't have the data dimensions. Logs, metrics, and traces are often referred to as the \"pillars of observability\". Tying this large collection of telemetry data will be the metadata/dimensionality you add to make sense of it all. The metadata you add will be unique to your application, how it is architected, and how you want to analyze it. Nearly as important as the types of telemetry data you will collect is how it is stored and how long it is stored. You can always remove unneeded data, but it\u2019s much harder to add it back after the fact.", "name": "A primer to understanding observability", "title": "A primer to understanding observability | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-04-04", "byline": ["Jamie Smith", "Ron Wen"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/primer-to-understanding-observability-elastic"}
{"body_content_window": " Rudolf E. Kalman, a Hungarian-American electrical engineer and mathematician, coined the term in the 1960s in several seminal papers around dynamical and observable systems. While the term is still used in the mathematical context, today it is commonly used in the context of infrastructure, service, and modern software application stacks. What is observability? While observability is a term that is used in multiple disciplines, in IT Operations, observability brings insights from your infrastructure and application telemetry data. There are two parts to observability that can be implemented in your organization. While software is often specified with functional requirements, there are often non-functional requirements as well. Concepts such as \u201cavailability\u201d, \u201cscalability\u201d, and \u201cusability\u201d. Observability is a non-functional requirement that is increasingly necessary as organizations adopt cloud technologies, thereby increasing runtime complexity. However, telemetry data based on the combination of logs, metrics, and traces allows you to understand how your applications, services, and infrastructure are performing. To truly know what is going on with your application ecosystem, your entire application environment and components should be \"observable\", as defined by the original concept sixty years ago. Once telemetry data is being produced, having an observability solution that aggregates, correlates, and analyzes all the telemetry data from your applications and infrastructure will bring you full-stack observability. An observability platform is the solution you use to evaluate and understand the end to end performance of your environment. But, without telemetry data from your applications, services, and infrastructure, there is no observability. An observability solution gives you visibility both in real-time and from a historical perspective. Why is observability important for modern DevOps? When data centers and monolithic applications roamed the Earth, production changes were infrequent and thoroughly planned. External dependencies were documented, and overall application health could be determined by monitoring a few well-known metrics. As companies increasingly digitize and adopt cloud technologies like kubernetes, they dramatically increase their runtime complexity, making observability a critical DevOps initiative With the distributed nature of modern applications today, no single team or individual has a complete picture of all the dependencies. Telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) is often siloed in different tools.", "name": "A primer to understanding observability", "title": "A primer to understanding observability | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-04-04", "byline": ["Jamie Smith", "Ron Wen"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/primer-to-understanding-observability-elastic"}
{"body_content_window": " Developer and operations teams spend too much time triaging problems due to swivel-chair investigations, resulting in a higher mean time to detection (MTTD) and mean time to resolution (MTTR). To address this increasing application complexity, you\u2019ll need more data to truly understand your environment and your users\u2019 experience. Observability is an attempt to address this complexity by instituting that mindset from both an infrastructure and application telemetry standpoint along with platforms that can consolidate, correlate, and analyze the performance of today\u2019s modern, distributed systems architecture for cloud-native applications. What questions can observability answer for developers, DevOps, ITOps and SRE teams? The benefits of observability vary based on the role you have: if you're looking at it from the perspective of a developer you'll likely be looking at things differently than if you were approaching it from an operations perspective, and different again if you're the business owner. While not an exhaustive list, here are some example IT operations, developer, and DevOps questions that you would be able to answer with a unified observability solution. Which of my services is unhealthy? What is our average response time for a given operation? What is causing some users to experience longer load times than others? How has the latest change created latency or impacted application performance? How am I doing compared to my SLO for this service? Which service should I try to tune first? What is the overall user experience for my application? How is the business performing? e.g. Is there too much shopping cart abandonment in my e-commerce application? How is observability different from monitoring? Monitoring allows you to answer simple questions about your application ecosystem, such as \"which of my servers are over utilized?\" or \"which applications have high response times or latency?\" and is based on the assumption that dependencies are well understood, and the overall health could be determined by monitoring the variance of a few known metrics. These measurements for servers, VMs or application services, often miss the context to show how that specific component interacts with upstream services and how it impacts downstream user experience. Monitoring focuses on answering the known unknowns .", "name": "A primer to understanding observability", "title": "A primer to understanding observability | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-04-04", "byline": ["Jamie Smith", "Ron Wen"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/primer-to-understanding-observability-elastic"}
{"body_content_window": " That means your observability solution will need cost-effective storage for the large volume of telemetry data you generate, at the granularity you need, and the time-frame you need it for. You will also need to have the ability to access your data in the ways that you want for quick and flexible analysis and rich visualizations. Be cautious with observability data stores that don\u2019t allow you full access and use of standardized or open source tools (example: OpenTelemetry) for future analysis. What are unknown unknowns and why are they important within the field of observability? While monitoring works for \u201cknown unknown\u201d issues, often the hardest problems to solve are the ones that are transient and infrequent that you don't even know to look for. They might arise due to changes in environment, the application, or a combination of factors. These are the types of problems that solidify the need to capture anything and everything, datawise. To understand and resolve the \u201cunknown unknowns\u201d. An observability platform or solution with a unified and scalable data store allows you not only to determine what was happening at the time of a particular issue, but also helps you understand when unexpected events occur by putting different signals into context and at your fingertips when you need to explore further. This ability to look back historically at application and infrastructure performance is a key differentiator for an observability platform versus a monitoring solution. How can observability help with productivity and eliminate tool silos within IT Operations and development teams? Quite often, organizations start out with a need for log aggregation. They get that up and running, then decide that they should also start gathering metrics from their expanding infrastructure, so they add another tool. This process repeats again with APM. Before long, they've got multiple monitoring tools for their application ecosystem, along with already siloed data stores, with different groups potentially having their own tools. While it's definitely possible to triage and resolve issues and errors with siloed tools, the swivel chair approach to diagnosing issues (trouble-shooting across multiple, single-purpose tools) definitely makes it harder. You lose the correlated and contextual aspects that an observability solution delivers. Also remember that multiple monitoring tools means that all aspects of the overhead are multiplied as well: administration, training, and storage, to name a few.", "name": "A primer to understanding observability", "title": "A primer to understanding observability | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-04-04", "byline": ["Jamie Smith", "Ron Wen"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/primer-to-understanding-observability-elastic"}

With the right research and investigation, finding an observability solution that allows you to instrument and observe everything in your IT environment in a cost-effective manner is within your reach. Conclusion There are a lot of approaches to observability and given the evolution and adoption of cloud and cloud-native technologies, we imagine observability will continue to evolve at a torrid pace moving forward. The ultimate goal? Full end-to-end observability across your application environments with all of your telemetry data. The ability to see across your infrastructure, application, and all the way to the end-user experience from a single dashboard. And the ability to correlate and contextualize telemetry data to your specific needs at any point and time for root cause analysis and debugging efforts. A comprehensive observability platform will allow you to monitor day-to-day application performance, troubleshoot known issues, optimize applications, and even uncover problems that you were totally unaware of as your environment evolves. Choosing the right observability platform will future-proof your capabilities and organizational knowledge for the long-term as your DevOps teams continue to adopt newer technologies to accelerate innovation , improve digital experiences resulting in a faster time to market.

Our initial inspection of logs for troubleshooting provided some insights, but not enough for a true fix. Luckily, we have Elastic Observability and its APM capabilities to dive in deeper and look under the hood at what was really happening within Elastic Security. And, more importantly, how we could improve its performance for customers. Here\u2019s the story of how the Elastic Security engineering team optimized the performance of detection rules in order to improve security visibility.", "name": "Elastic on Elastic - Using Elastic Observability to optimize the performance of detection rules in Elastic Security", "title": "Elastic on Elastic - Using Elastic Observability to optimize the performance of detection rules in Elastic Security | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-03-29", "byline": ["Dmitrii Shevchenko"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/using-elastic-observability-to-optimize-the-performance-of-detection-rules-in-elastic-security"}
{"body_content_window": " In this post, I would like to share some of the details on how we accomplished that goal with Elastic Observability. The importance of detection rules for Elastic Security Detection rules are at the heart of Elastic Security . Their job is to search Elasticsearch indices periodically (i.e. logs) for suspicious source events and notify SOC analysts when a rule\u2019s conditions are met. Elastic Security might execute hundreds and even thousands of detection rules in the background, so their performance is critical, as any slowness could lead to scan gaps and potentially missed alerts and threats. The main focus was on reducing the median execution time of detection rules per Kibana instance for a given volume of data. Metrics related to memory or CPU usage were not considered since rule execution operations are I/O bound. Challenges around measuring application performance One challenge when testing the performance of detection rules is that they run on a schedule in the background. It makes them different from classic REST APIs, to which you can make a series of requests and measure the response time or use off-the-shelf tools such as ApacheBench. We needed a way to collect all the required performance-related metrics during rule execution. As a team, we were already collecting some execution-related metrics such as total rule execution time and maximum read and write time. While these metrics could answer some questions and help identify rules that execute heavy queries, it was difficult to use this information for general performance testing and identification of bottlenecks. Another challenge was the many layers of abstractions around the rule execution code. Many teams contribute to the detection engine and the core framework it\u2019s built upon. As a result, when a developer calls a framework\u2019s method, they are not always aware of the database requests being made under the hood since the framework is owned and maintained by other teams. This makes performance optimizations particularly hard as all the complexity is hidden. To effectively track and understand the performance, the goal was to visualize what\u2019s going on inside the rule executors and track every database request. Baselining and measuring application performance Before starting any optimization work, it was important to understand the current situation and collect relevant performance metrics. To endeavor on any optimizations without this context would be like shooting in the dark. When measuring performance, the first option that came to mind was to use standard Node.js tools like the Performance API and the built-in profiler.", "name": "Elastic on Elastic - Using Elastic Observability to optimize the performance of detection rules in Elastic Security", "title": "Elastic on Elastic - Using Elastic Observability to optimize the performance of detection rules in Elastic Security | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-03-29", "byline": ["Dmitrii Shevchenko"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/using-elastic-observability-to-optimize-the-performance-of-detection-rules-in-elastic-security"}
{"body_content_window": " However, these tools are pretty low-level and require a substantial time investment to work with. We wanted something simpler and ready to use out of the box. Since Elastic Security and Elastic Observability are built on the same Elasticsearch platform and deliver the value of being able to secure and observe at the same time, we decided to try Elastic Observability. Elastic Observability can be set up to collect performance metrics in a matter of minutes and record important application events \u2014 like HTTP requests and database queries \u2014 without any prior configuration. With the APM agent deployed, it was pretty easy to start collecting telemetry data right away. Provision Elastic Observability cloud cluster Enable and configure Elastic node.js APM agent (Note: Kibana comes integrated with the Elastic node.js APM agent for self-monitoring, details here .) We enabled about 500 detection rules to generate load and navigated to the APM section of Elastic Observability to see tracing details. Within Elastic APM it was easy to find the rule execution transactions and the corresponding performance charts quickly. With the out-of-the-box average rule execution latency and distribution as initial parameters and baseline, all consequent optimization work would be compared to these numbers. The optimization process for Elastic Security Once we had gathered the initial, baseline numbers, it was now time to start searching for optimization opportunities. By default, the Elastic APM agent collects all outgoing requests and Elasticsearch queries. Distributed traces with rich contextual information about user, url, payload, and query details are also provided out of the box by Elastic Observability. By simply reviewing the trace, one can visualize the paths that the code follows under the hood making it possible to spot bottlenecks. For example, it was apparent which outgoing Elasticsearch queries were taking the longest to execute among the transactions. It is also worth noting that code path uniformity should be considered when examining performance. The analyzed code may have logical conditions that significantly affect the number of operations performed. For example, cached data or exceptions lead to early execution termination. And if a mixture of transactions with different spans count falls into the analyzed sample, this can significantly skew the final results. So prepare in advance different execution paths and split the tests into homogeneous groups. To provide even more information about the execution of a specific code path, we added custom instrumentation to executors with spans.", "name": "Elastic on Elastic - Using Elastic Observability to optimize the performance of detection rules in Elastic Security", "title": "Elastic on Elastic - Using Elastic Observability to optimize the performance of detection rules in Elastic Security | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-03-29", "byline": ["Dmitrii Shevchenko"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/using-elastic-observability-to-optimize-the-performance-of-detection-rules-in-elastic-security"}
{"body_content_window": " Spans add contextual information to executed code blocks like name, labels, outcome, etc. That way, we could visualize actual business logic rather than raw method calls. After identifying the slowest methods, it\u2019s time to analyze code for performance problems. Some of the glaring issues identified were: Inefficient database calls - Analyzing spans highlighted a couple of database calls that request the same data from different places. This was easy to fix by reorganizing the code. Lack of parallelization - Some requests were being sent serially instead of being sent in parallel. Usage of refresh=wait_for - When writing documents we often included this parameter unnecessarily. This parameter makes every Elasticsearch write operation wait for an index update, which adds up to one extra second to every call. Lack of batching - Many documents were written in a row instead of buffering write operations and sending only one bulk write request to the database. Results of application optimization with Elastic Observability Some of the issues surfaced were easy to fix, so I decided to take the initiative and corrected them right away. That first optimization pass led to a reduction in the average rule execution time of about 30%. This investigation also sparked several inter-team discussions and has resulted in plans to invest even more time to make rule executors even faster. Optimizing application performance is a never-ending goal for developer teams but with Elastic Observability, we can approach this work systematically and with real data points. Observability and Security on a unified platform As oftentimes with software development, the identified performance issues could have been avoided. Instead of optimizing the performance of detection rules after the fact, a more proactive approach would have been preferable. Teams should consider increased instrumentation at the start of development work to collect performance data. With a proper observability solution in place, teams can incorporate performance review as part of their standard code review process proactively and fix performance issues in earlier development stages. This optimization project was a great example of the better-together nature of the Elastic Security and Observability solutions. My knowledge and expertise around Elastic Security made it very easy for me to learn Elastic Observability, deploy the solution, and quickly find real answers. With Elastic, it\u2019s easy to leverage your Elasticsearch expertise for both observability and security initiatives.

Serverless functions, such as the AWS Lambda service, provide a high level of abstraction from the underlying infrastructure and orchestration, given these tasks are managed by the cloud provider. Software development teams can then focus on the implementation of business and application logic. Some additional benefits include billing for serverless functions based on the actual compute and memory resources consumed, along with automatic on-demand scaling. One difficulty in using serverless functions, however, is making them observable in the wider end-to-end microservices architecture context.", "name": "Get visibility into AWS Lambda serverless functions with Elastic Observability", "title": "Get visibility into AWS Lambda serverless functions with Elastic Observability | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-12", "byline": ["Akhilesh Pokhariyal"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/observability-apm-aws-lambda-serverless-functions"}
{"body_content_window": " \u201cReliability is critical for us when it comes to monitoring our production applications. As such, we were eager to make the switch from the OpenTelemetry AWS Lambda Agent to the Elastic AWS Lambda APM Agent. We are very pleased that Elastic has released a fully supported and a properly tested product for delivering crucial end-to-end visibility into applications that employ serverless functions.\u201d - Tech Lead, Multi-brand online retailer in the UK and Ireland Elastic APM for AWS Lambda: The architecture In a previous blog post, we showed how to trace AWS Lambdas with OpenTelemetry and Elastic Observability . The Elastic APM (application performance monitoring) solution for AWS Lambda functions provides performance monitoring, error monitoring, and topology views showing dependencies within the distributed microservices architecture. Additionally, the APM agent provides auto-instrumentation of traces, transactions, and spans out of the box. The key components of the solution for monitoring AWS Lambda are the Elastic APM agent for the relevant language, the APM Lambda Extension, and the APM server. Each of these components is available as open-source code in GitHub repositories, and the solution can be trialed free of charge. The APM server validates and processes incoming events from individual APM agents and transforms them into Elasticsearch documents. The APM agent provides auto-instrumentation capabilities for the application being observed. The APM Lambda Extension is responsible for the transmission of data to the APM server and for the collection of Lambda-specific logs and metrics. The Lambda Extension ensures that any potential latency between the Lambda function and the APM Server instance will not cause latency in the request flow of the Lambda function itself. Currently, the solution supports auto-instrumentation of AWS Lambda functions written in Node.js, Java, and Python. In addition to traces, the APM agent identifies cold starts of AWS Lambda functions and collects trigger-specific information for each Lambda invocation, as well as metadata associated with the AWS Lambda runtime.", "name": "Get visibility into AWS Lambda serverless functions with Elastic Observability", "title": "Get visibility into AWS Lambda serverless functions with Elastic Observability | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-12", "byline": ["Akhilesh Pokhariyal"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/observability-apm-aws-lambda-serverless-functions"}
{"body_content_window": " Setting up Elastic APM for AWS Lambdas In general, there are two different ways of deploying and using AWS Lambda functions: Deploying code as a .zip archive and using Lambda Layers for additional resources Deploying all resources through Docker images Though Elastic primarily supports and documents the use of Elastic APM with the first option at this time, you can also use our APM agents and Lambda Extension artifacts to build your custom Docker image for the second deployment option. Setting up Elastic APM for your Node.js, Python, or Java-based AWS Lambda functions is easy and involves the following three steps: Install the Elastic APM agent for the language you are using in your AWS Lambda function. Add Elastic\u2019s APM Lambda Extension as a layer to your Lambda function. Configure the APM agent and the APM Lambda Extension through the Lambda function\u2019s environment variables. The additional Elastic artifacts added to your Lambda function (APM agent and APM Lambda Extension) are in total less than 20MB, which is less than 10% of AWS\u2019s 250MB limit when deploying Lambda functions through the first option mentioned above. The Quick Start guides provide language-specific setup instructions for different deployment frameworks and approaches, such as AWS Web console, Terraform, AWS CLI, SAM, and the Serverless framework. The Node.js sample application To demonstrate the setup and usage of Elastic APM for an AWS Lambda-based Node.js application, we prepared a sample application . It uses the Serverless framework to manage the deployment of the AWS resources. The sample application explained The sample application includes two AWS Lambda functions, producer and consumer , that are made accessible through an AWS API Gateway. Whenever the producer is invoked, it calls the consumer Lambda function through the API Gateway. In addition, the sample project provides a simple, APM-instrumented load generator that periodically invokes the producer. The project contains two sub-directories: one for the target serverless application ( lambda-application ), and one for the Node.js-based client that is used for generating load to the target application ( load-generator ). The Lambda application includes the following relevant files: handler.js serverless.yml The handler.js file contains the two Node.js functions ( producer and consumer ) that encapsulate the handler logic for two different AWS Lambda functions.", "name": "Get visibility into AWS Lambda serverless functions with Elastic Observability", "title": "Get visibility into AWS Lambda serverless functions with Elastic Observability | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-12", "byline": ["Akhilesh Pokhariyal"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/observability-apm-aws-lambda-serverless-functions"}

Both AWS Lambda functions are made accessible through an API Gateway using the events section. The provider section in the serverless.yml file contains configurations that are applied to all the AWS Lambda functions defined in this document. To enable Elastic APM for the AWS Lambda functions, the only two sections that are relevant are the layers and environment sections. With the former, we instruct the AWS Lambda functions to import the public, ready-to-use Lambda layers for Elastic\u2019s APM Lambda extension and the Elastic Node.js APM agent. Note that the AWS region and the architecture (for example, x86_64 vs. arm64 ) of the layers must match the region and architecture of the target AWS Lambda functions. The AWS region is configured centrally in the top-level env.json file. In the environment section, the NODE_OPTIONS environment variable ensures that the APM Node.js agent is hooked into the Node.js process when the Lambda function is loaded. Finally, ELASTIC_APM_LAMBDA_APM_SERVER points to the APM server endpoint secured by the ELASTIC_APM_SECRET_TOKEN .

{"body_content_window": " For AWS Lambda services, Elastic APM shows a cold start rate chart that shows the rate of cold starts (portion of requests that hit a cold start).Moreover, as illustrated in the following screenshot, you can use the Correlation feature to see the impact of Lambda cold starts on the latency, for example. With the default configuration of the APM agents, you will get one APM service in Elastic Observability corresponding to exactly one AWS Lambda function (using the function name as the service name). However, sometimes it is desirable to logically group multiple lambda functions under one APM service. You can achieve this by setting the ELASTIC_APM_SERVICE_NAME environment variable on the corresponding Lambda functions using the same value. The following screenshot shows the effect in the sample application of setting the static service name (here: composite-service ) for both the producer and consumer Lambda functions. Both Lambda functions now appear under one APM service, and the pop-up on the Lambda icon lists the included AWS Lambda function names. The two different Lambda functions now appear as two different transaction groups ( POST /dev/produce and GET /dev/ping ). Each chart on the composite-service service page shows aggregated data for the two Lambda functions. Collecting AWS Lambda metrics and logs What about the other observability signals, metrics and logs? AWS Lambda writes logs into CloudWatch. You can use Elastic\u2019s Functionbeat to pipe data streams from AWS CloudWatch logs to the Elastic Stack. If you configure the APM agents to use ECS logging , you will get direct correlation between traces and related logs in Elastic APM. You can also use the AWS Lambda Metrics integration in Elastic to gather and analyze AWS Lambda-specific metrics. We are continuing to work on improving the onboarding experience, lowering total cost of ownership, and simplifying the use of Elastic Observability. To this end, we plan to integrate logs and metrics collection seamlessly into the APM Lambda extension in the future. This will allow AWS Lambda users to consume the full range of observability data with the minimal setup described above, while also avoiding the time and cost associated with the CloudWatch API.

Nonetheless, CIOs should start with an unglamorous but necessary step: an audit of their current data infrastructure. Luckily, machine learning algorithms can help automate the process. For instance, they can analyze structured data, such as labeled fields within a database, and then apply those insights to similar data from other sources. \u201cHaving structured data that\u2019s labeled can help you uncover information in the unstructured world,\u201d says Riley. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve looked at everything, you can get smarter about how you retrieve data from sources that aren\u2019t as structured.\u201d Focus on personalized results In the consumer world, someone searching for restaurants or traffic information would get different results based on location data. That same kind of personalization can help make workplaces more productive. For instance, when an employee in sales has a question, there\u2019s a good chance they\u2019re looking for a different answer than a colleague from finance or engineering. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to rethink how we provide information: from passive to active, from one-size-fits-all to personalized, from static to dynamic, based on who you are, where you are, and what you\u2019re trying to do,\u201d says Carver, the UAB CIO. CIOs can start down that path by having teams preload a worker\u2019s search tools with information like what their role is, what sort of data they might look for, and what types of information would be irrelevant to their queries.

Most of these transformation efforts \u2014 ambitious projects to use technology to change a business model or overhaul how employees do their jobs \u2014 fall well short of their goals, according to Boston Consulting Group . Nonetheless, CIOs and other executives keep following the same playbook: Brainstorm improved customer experiences, write a business plan, and decide on the tools to implement, says best-selling author Michael Watkins, co-founder of the global leadership consulting firm Genesis Advisers.", "name": "Insights: How hybrid work models can provide the culture change CIOs need for successful digital transformation", "title": "How Hybrid Work Models Help Digital Transformation | Elastic | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2021-09-27", "byline": ["Peter Burrows"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/how-hybrid-work-models-help-digital-transformation"}
{"body_content_window": " Key takeaways \u2022 Digital transformation projects fail 70% of the time because of cultural reasons \u2022 The same changes that help an organization adapt to new hybrid work models will help it succeed with transformation efforts \u2022 Good communication and clear executive stakeholders are key So Watkins, who has helped steer dozens of companies through digital transformation projects, got excited earlier this year when a large consumer-products company came to him with a different ask: equip its top 100 executives with the know-how to quickly change its culture. The company wanted to identify how its values and practices needed to evolve to best support its digital initiatives, and how to best communicate with employees and win their buy-in. For Watkins, the request was a welcome change. \u201cMost management teams realize they need to transition to a new way of working,\u201d he says. But when it comes to culture change, \u201cthey usually under resource it.\u201d Embracing a hybrid work model helps digital transformation efforts succeed That\u2019s where the rapid shift to distributed or hybrid-work models comes in. At the outset of the pandemic, companies removed constraints on where, when, and how people get their jobs done. Forced to re-learn how to work together, companies invested in tools that brought people together virtually and teams started to communicate more. The result: 70% of IT leaders report the pandemic led to increased collaboration between business and technology teams, according to KPMG, and 40% of employees say their companies have become more transparent . Those are some of the factors, study after study finds, that make digital transformation projects more likely to succeed. Geoffrey Moore, a leading management consultant in Silicon Valley and author of several best-selling business books including \u201cCrossing the Chasm,\u201d says this isn\u2019t a coincidence. \u201cEmbracing the hybrid model is forcing companies to adopt a collaboration culture,\u201d he says. The ones that do it successfully, he says, will be \u201cin the catbird seat to win\u201d the larger battle to digitally transform. If culture change is an imperative more urgent than ever before, how should CIOs go about transforming the employee experience? Here are steps that will help with the current challenge of hybrid work and pay long-term dividends for digital transformation efforts. Culture needs its own infrastructure investment into employee experience As Watkins\u2019 work with the consumer-products client shows \u2014 it touched 100 top executives, who each then trained around 15 of their direct reports \u2014 enacting culture change requires a deep commitment and significant resources.", "name": "Insights: How hybrid work models can provide the culture change CIOs need for successful digital transformation", "title": "How Hybrid Work Models Help Digital Transformation | Elastic | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2021-09-27", "byline": ["Peter Burrows"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/how-hybrid-work-models-help-digital-transformation"}
{"body_content_window": " \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to create digital processes. It\u2019s quite another to get people to embrace collaboration as an imperative.\u201d Michael Watkins, co-founder of the global leadership consulting firm Genesis Advisers That starts with an infrastructure that helps employees do their jobs. During the pandemic, companies have accelerated investments in cloud data storage and tools that help workers find the data they need to make decisions. Companies have also invested in video conferencing, chat software, and collaboration tools. Even more so, they\u2019ve invested the time to make sure these new tools are put to use. At the consumer-products company, Watkins says the executives spent three days creating detailed plans on what they would do over the next 90 days to implement their ideas in reality. \u201cThat\u2019s where the rubber meets the road,\u201d says Wakins. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to create digital processes. It\u2019s quite another to get people to embrace collaboration as an imperative.\u201d Among the steps employees say their companies are taking to aid the shift to remote work is facilitating opportunities for people to connect with one another, and creating more time for employees to engage with their managers, according to a study by Quartz and Qualtrics . The upshot is that these same employees report feeling more connected and more loyal to their organizations. Furthermore, 37% said their company\u2019s culture has improved during the pandemic, compared to just 15% who say it\u2019s deteriorated. That\u2019s another harbinger of success for digital transformation: BCG found that enterprises that emphasize building strong organizational cultures are five times more likely to achieve significant financial gains on their digital transformation efforts and deliver higher returns on investment in the long run. Good communication is a must Most of the people in the Quartz/Qualtrics survey who said their company culture improved also said that the company became more transparent during the pandemic. They also said people in their workplace have become more generous and kind. Elastic has seen the payoff from that approach first-hand. As a distributed company, it operates around a few central principles it calls a \u201c source code ,\u201d including humility, work-life balance, and diversity. These are key in grounding how employees are expected to communicate in a hybrid framework. For example, one tenet reads: \u201cWith many languages, perspectives, and cultures, it\u2019s easy to lose something in translation.

But her favorite utility isn\u2019t a jigsaw or cordless drill.

{"body_content_window": " Observability\u2014software that integrates data from various departments and applications \u2014makes it possible to monitor how customers experience the performance of the 350 websites that Romero oversees. On her watch, the tools have spotted some problems before customers notice. \u201cWe no longer have customers calling us to say our websites are down,\u201d says Romero. \u201cObservability tools let us spot any degradation of performance and identify the root cause so we can address it proactively.\u201d Observability enables businesses and IT teams to trace customer issues back to an offending application, process, or device, so that they can quickly address the issue and make changes to prevent it from recurring. Before the emergence of observability software, most IT shops used a patchwork of point solutions to track metrics, logs and traces for individual departments. But the fragmented products were expensive to support and didn\u2019t capture bigger-picture insights. The latest observability tools can search many types of data\u2014such as operational data logs and records from application performance monitoring (APM) systems\u2014to spot relationships that no one had thought to track. A cable company, for example, might learn that increased customer churn was associated not with the usual suspects such as router problems, but perhaps to a glitchy upgrade of remote control software. Observability drives better customer experiences Observability can be especially critical in improving customer experience. If a website doesn\u2019t work as advertised, 42% of visitors will leave and never come back; a site that takes too long to load can lose two-thirds of its visitors. \u201cYou need observability tools in this age because the web is like a public utility,\u201d says Romero. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer OK for a page to load slowly or not at all. Customer expectations are far too high for that.\u201d Observability can also make IT operations efficient by directing staffers to the precise cause of a problem instead of forcing them to go on fishing expeditions using data that may not result in the right solution. Through additional data analysis, observability software also generates actionable insights for understanding the customer experience from the enormous amount of data produced by monitoring systems, says Jayne Groll, CEO of the DevOps Institute. \u201cYou could easily get buried under mountains of data without observability tools,\u201d she says.", "name": "Insights: Why observability is the CIO's secret weapon to improve customer experience", "title": "How observability drives better customer experiences | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2021-12-16", "byline": ["David Rand"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/how-observability-drives-better-customer-experiences"}
{"body_content_window": " For example, Furuno, a Japanese maker of marine electronics and satellite communications systems, recently used observability tools from Elastic to resolve complaints from shipping customers about spotty internet service and increasing monthly data charges. Previously these problems had been hard to troubleshoot because it took on average two days to get performance logs from satellite service providers, and even then the data came in the form of massive spreadsheets. It wasn\u2019t obvious whether the problems stemmed from a broken antenna, bad weather, or sailors using excessive bandwidth to stream movies. With observability, Furuno can now see an integrated picture of the various data sources, delivered to computers on customers\u2019 vessels, which can lead to diagnosing why the internet was not working properly within an hour. The observable future Observability technology is positioned to make significant advances as ML capabilities are added. With current tools, it\u2019s still up to human analysts to figure out how to respond to the tool\u2019s insights, says Scott Sinclair, a senior industry analyst with Enterprise Strategy Group. Over the next few years, he says, machine learning capabilities will help observability tools diagnose failures and present solutions in real time, giving customer and IT teams a better chance to achieve a core objective\u2014to keep more customers happier, around the clock, at times before they\u2019re even aware of the problem. \u201cWe\u2019ve only scratched the surface,\u201d says Sinclair.

But done well, they solidify your relationship as a customer, and reinforce that you\u2019re getting the service you deserve. But let\u2019s flip that around \u2014 how can you help your organization deliver that kind of personalized experience to your customers?

{"body_content_window": " But the massive amounts of data needed to really bring personalization to life is something not every organization has at their fingertips. And even if they have the data, they might not have the ability to access or process it. Unless, of course, they\u2019re already on Elastic. In the banking and payments sector, digital customer experiences have been a critical investment area for over a decade. However, given the industry's complexity and highly regulated nature, the primary focus has been on making sure online channels meet basic security, compliance, and customer requirements. However, personalization is the next frontier. Institutions are looking for new ways of presenting customers with journeys that speak to their unique financial needs \u2014 offering the right content or service at the right time with the right interaction. In order to do this, unlocking data is vital. And more than most industries, financial providers are sitting on a wealth of customer data points to drive personalization. For example, banking and payment customers share valuable information with financial institutions when they open accounts \u2014 followed by fluctuations in account balances and asset values, and in their daily transactions. And customers are accessing their financial data across a bevy of digital touchpoints throughout their banking journey, from payment apps, to third party websites, to tax and financial planning software. Banks have the ability to have the clearest picture in history of who their customers are and what financial products and services they need \u2014 if only they used this data. If the data exists, why is personalization so hard? According to Deloitte , only 30% of customers believe that their banks are personalizing their service offerings. One challenge for banks is integrating and using the necessary real-time structured and unstructured data from internal and external sources. To accomplish this, providers need to set up an integrated data infrastructure that enables data to be seamlessly processed, ingested, and updated frequently. With better access to data, banking and payment providers can use tactics like data analytics, behavioral science, and ethnographic research to better target their customers. How Elastic helps personalization Elastic enables banks and payment companies to unify siloed data structures \u2014 correlating decades\u2019 worth of data, even when there\u2019s no single repository or unified structure. Elastic centrally stores data for lightning-fast search, fine\u2011tuned relevancy, and powerful analytics that scales with ease, allowing technical and non-technical functions to better serve customers based on individual needs.", "name": "Personalization in Banking: Knocking down barriers with Elastic", "title": "Banks are enabling personalization with Elastic \u2014 your industry can, too | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-03-02", "byline": ["Brandon Mavleos"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/how-banks-are-enabling-personalization-thanks-to-elastic"}

More recently, the inability to meet in person has forced us to rely more heavily on technology to assist with our basic household and business needs: ordering groceries online and food delivery, scheduling appointments, streaming entertainment services, renewing vehicle registrations, and hosting virtual meetings and events. As a result, developers are in a position to directly impact and improve the day-to-day digital experience that customers expect. And developers that proactively move toward a customer-first approach and embrace that responsibility for CX will emerge as leaders in their field.", "name": "Why developers are putting customer experience first", "title": "Why developers are putting customer experience first | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-03-14", "byline": ["Ron Wen"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-developers-are-putting-customer-experience-first"}
{"body_content_window": " Customer expectations raise the bar for application performance Have you ever had a poor digital experience while shopping online, using your banking app, scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment, or filing your taxes? Pulled up an app that crashed or hung up on you? Clicked on a link while purchasing an item or service online, only to get a spinning hourglass? Studies have shown that consumers have little to no tolerance for poorly performing apps and are highly likely to delete an app, quickly move to a competitor\u2019s offering, or choose a less efficient method of completing the transaction. And even one bad experience can negatively affect a customer's view of an organization and their brand for an extended period of time. Because developers are creating customer-facing experiences, they are directly responsible for and connected to their customers. Providing Level 3 production support for their applications and responding to customer complaints and outages is part of the customer relationship. Truly understanding where the friction is occurring in the user experience from both a functional and performance standpoint can uncover what needs to be fixed next \u2014 and effectively conquering these CX challenges can yield benefits for the individual developer as well as their broader organization. High-performing apps define the customer experience Being able to deliver innovative new applications, services, and functionality quickly to create a great customer experience can be crucial for long-term organizational success. And getting alignment between customers and developers is incredibly important, both internally and externally. Developers are increasingly being seen as drivers of an organization and its brand. Applications that are not just functional but reliable, scalable, and secure generate customer trust and revenue.. Application performance monitoring (APM) can be a key tool in ensuring the consistent delivery of customer and digital experiences that delight their users. Evolving tools and expertise for a CX-first approach Whether you\u2019re coding, ideating and collaborating with your squad, researching new coding best practices, debugging issues, or on-call, all your work is about serving your customers and making their lives easier, more efficient, and more interesting. But with today\u2019s rapid, iterative software development lifecycle and more distributed working environments, there\u2019s a lot of room for error. It also means that your team\u2019s skills and tools need to stay focused on delivering not just features and function but also a consistent and excellent customer experience. Having a full understanding of how your application and code performs in your production environment is crucial not only for troubleshooting, but also making sure your code runs effectively under all conditions in the wild.", "name": "Why developers are putting customer experience first", "title": "Why developers are putting customer experience first | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-03-14", "byline": ["Ron Wen"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-developers-are-putting-customer-experience-first"}
{"body_content_window": " And in today\u2019s cloud-native, microservices, and SOA, SLO-driven world, this has never been more difficult. Taking on that additional responsibility of making sure your application is working effectively for your users beyond your QA environment is absolutely necessary. While monitoring and logging is a great first step, the journey to an application performance monitoring (APM) or unified observability solution (which includes APM) should be your goal as a developer, SRE, or DevOps professional. That\u2019s why a CX-first approach is so crucial for your customer, your business, and your own professional development. Instrumenting and collecting all your telemetry data to truly understand the production performance characteristics of your application and the end-user experience is a great way to prevent issues from happening and proactively improving application performance. APM for CX initiatives A customer-first mindset requires you to adopt DevOps principles such as the collection of all your telemetry data (logs, metrics, and traces) and always-on analysis using tools such as APM. Understand the importance of instrumenting your entire application environment to create more consistency and repeatability in your CI/CD pipeline. Also consider how a well-designed APM solution will prove to be more cost-effective over the years as your environment grows. After all, it\u2019s not just about the technology, it\u2019s the impact your application has on the human being and user on the other end that\u2019s using it. So here\u2019s to embracing the CX-first perspective as a developer, because the closer you are to the customer, the more important you are to the organization.

Perhaps you have ingested custom data using default settings and would like to know where your data modeling efforts could make the largest impact? In this blog post we will look at how to use Elastic\u2019s recently introduced disk usage API to answer such questions. Here at Elastic, when we work with our customers, one of the most common areas of improvement is index mapping configuration. A lack of mappings, or using the wrong types, can increase storage usage in your Elastic deployment. This post will help you understand what fields are most influential in driving your storage footprint and how you can optimize consumption through best-practice configuration.", "name": "Analyze and Optimize Your Footprint with the Disk Usage API", "title": "How to analyze and optimize the storage footprint of your Elastic deployment | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-03-15", "byline": ["Mattias Brunnert"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/how-to-analyze-and-optimize-the-storage-footprint-of-your-elastic-deployment-disk-usage-api"}
{"body_content_window": " Getting started If you are not already using Elastic, create a deployment using our hosted Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud . The deployment includes an Elasticsearch cluster for storing and searching your data, and a Kibana instance for visualizing and managing your data. For more information, see spin up the Elastic Stack . I recommend using a development or staging environment for this exercise. You will also need some data in an Elasticsearch index to analyze. If you have created a brand new cluster, you can add some sample data using Kibana . In my example, I have used some log data ingested using Filebeat . If you are using Elastic\u2019s Beats or Elastic Agent to index data, chances are it will already be modeled according to Elastic\u2019s best practices. This is of course fantastic, except it does make this exercise a bit less interesting. Fortunately we can easily discard our data model by copying it to an index without a mapping configuration. I picked one of my indices and executed the following reindex operation using Kibana dev tools: POST _reindex/ { \"source\": { \"index\": \"filebeat-7.16.2-2022.01.06-000001\" }, \"dest\": { \"index\": \"nomapping-filebeat\" } } Note that I have chosen a target index name that starts with a prefix that does not match any of Elastic\u2019s standard index patterns. This ensures mappings are not automatically applied from one of my index templates. By having two copies of the index, one with appropriate mappings and one without, we will be able to do a side by side comparison later in the blog post. The final prerequisite is jq , which is a great tool for manipulating json. We will use jq to transform the API response into a list of documents, which we can easily ingest into Elasticsearch using Kibana. This will make the analysis of the API response easier using the Discover interface through Kibana. Using the disk usage API Calling the disk usage API is simple, just go to Kibana dev tools and issue a request similar to: POST nomapping-filebeat/_disk_usage?run_expensive_tasks=true Note the run_expensive_tasks parameter is required ,and by providing it I acknowledge that I am putting additional load on the cluster. This is also the reason for my earlier recommendation to do the exercise in a non-production cluster.", "name": "Analyze and Optimize Your Footprint with the Disk Usage API", "title": "How to analyze and optimize the storage footprint of your Elastic deployment | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-03-15", "byline": ["Mattias Brunnert"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/how-to-analyze-and-optimize-the-storage-footprint-of-your-elastic-deployment-disk-usage-api"}

We can see that the inverted index is the largest factor, followed by stored fields and doc values. Looking further down the response, I get a breakdown of each field, including the host.name field. \"fields\" : { \u2026 \"host.name\" : { \"total\" : \"23.2kb\", \"total_in_bytes\" : 23842, \"inverted_index\" : { \"total\" : \"23.2kb\", \"total_in_bytes\" : 23842 }, \u2026 We could easily be satisfied with the API results. By using the CTRL-F function in the response tab and searching for \u201cmb\u201d, as in megabyte, we would quickly identify a few large fields in our index. Let\u2019s take it one step further though and look at how we can quickly reformat the response and analyze it using Kibana.

{"body_content_window": " Then run the command below, replacing nomapping-filebeat with your index name and disk-usage-filebeat.json with your recently saved file: jq -c '. [\"nomapping-filebeat\"].fields | to_entries | map({field: .key} + .value) | . []' disk-usage-filebeat.json > disk-usage-ld.json The command transforms the json into a list of objects, each including a field name and related usage data, and outputs newline delimited json. See the jq manual for more information. We can now upload the data using the data visualizer , found under Machine learning in Kibana. Once you have navigated to the visualizer, click import file and upload your disk-usage-ld.json file. The resulting page should include fields similar to the screenshot below, matching the field analytics in the API response. Scroll down, click import and name your index where the disk usage data will be stored. Make sure to check the \u201ccreate index pattern\u201d tick box. As you can see I named my index disk-usage.

Now we are ready to visualize our field data. Navigate to Discover and select the disk-usage index pattern. Add the following columns: field stored_fields_in_bytes inverted_index.total_in_bytes doc_values_in_bytes total_in_bytes Sort on total_in_bytes in descending order. As you can see my largest field is _source. This is a built in field that stores the original document , and one we almost always want to keep. The next two fields are host.mac and host.ip.

{"body_content_window": " As per Elasticsearch's dynamic mapping defaults , these fields have been set to text with a keyword multi-field. I also notice that the text fields \u2019 storage is taken up by the inverted index, which is used for search, while the keyword fields \u2019 are dominated by doc_values, which are used for aggregations and sorting. Adding the text and keyword sizes together, the total sizes are: host.mac + host.mac.keyword = 5.3 MB host.ip + host.ip.keyword = 3 MB Comparing to Best Practice Lets navigate to Dev tools and take a look at the original filebeat index. This index has the Elastic Common Schema mapping already applied out of the box. I retrieve the disk usage information from my original index using: POST filebeat-7.16.2-2022.01.06-000001/_disk_usage?run_expensive_tasks=true From the response I read the following for the host.ip and host.mac fields: \"host.ip\" : { \"total\" : \"1.3mb\" \u2026 \"host.mac\" : { \"total\" : \"492.1kb\", \u2026 As we can see, the storage usage is lower by a factor of 2-5. To take a look at the mapping, we can retrieve it using: GET filebeat-7.16.2-2022.01.06-000001/_mapping/field/host.ip,host.mac I can see that host.ip is mapped as ip and host.mac is mapped as keyword. In most cases, the type of data stored in these fields will be used for exact filtering, aggregations and sorting which means that having them mapped as a text field does not provide further value for analysis and takes up extra storage space in the cluster. Conclusion and Next Steps In this blog post we have seen how we can use the disk usage API to understand what fields are most expensive in terms of storage utilization.

{"body_content_window": " Please note that if you don\u2019t send data to Elasticsearch directly, for example if you send Filebeat data via Logstash, you might need to load your index templates manually . Configure Mappings If you are using custom data, you often need to configure your mappings manually. To make sure your mapping is applied, define it within an index template with the appropriate index patterns. Mapping individual fields quickly becomes tedious. For most machine generated data we usually want to map most strings to the keyword type, so including a dynamic template as the example below will save a lot of time. Don\u2019t forget to add specific mappings for ips and for text meant for free text search, such as the standard field \u201cmessage\u201d. \"mappings\": { \"dynamic_templates\": [ { \"strings_as_keyword\" : { \"match_mapping_type\" : \"string\", \"mapping\" : { \"ignore_above\" : 1024, \"type\" : \"keyword\" } } } ] } When naming and assigning types to your fields we recommend consulting the Elastic Common Schema . It will help you build a consistent data model and allow you to view your custom data in Kibana\u2019s applications. Implement Storage Tiers A slightly tangential, but important, tool to optimize your storage footprint is data tiers . By using data tiers you can move data to cheaper hardware as it ages. Our frozen tier even lets you store data in blob storage , which dramatically reduces costs and is designed for data that is rarely accessed or when slower query responses are acceptable. The easiest way to manage data tiers is by using Elastic Cloud, have a look at our best practices for managing data to get you started.

Offices like Technology Transformation Services are charged with designing and delivering a digital government with and for the public. As such, customer experience strategists, user experience designers, technical innovation analysts, and others are integral to modernizing digital experiences and in many cases helping agencies meet requirements outlined in the Executive Order on Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild Trust in Government . In their roles within government or educational institutions, CX professionals apply human-centered design principles. How does search fit into the equation? In this blog, we discuss five ways CX professionals can use search to transform public sector websites and employee intranets so that people can find relevant information faster. 1.", "name": "5 ways search can modernize digital experiences in public sector", "title": "5 ways search can modernize digital experiences in public sector | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-03-16", "byline": ["Suzzanna Martinez"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/search-can-modernize-digital-experiences-in-public-sector-government"}
{"body_content_window": " Supercharge your digital front door As the digital front door to your organization, your website is a critical resource for citizens and students. They don\u2019t browse your website like they do their social media feeds, they come to your website to find answers and take care of their personal affairs. It\u2019s not enough to have a search function on the website, although that is one component of the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act. Your website search should be supercharged with: A web crawler with automated crawls to keep your search index fresh Algorithms such as typo tolerance, bigram matching, stemming, and synonyms Relevance tuning to inform page rank, field weights and precision Natural language processing and vector search for machine learning-powered personalization, superior relevance, and search performance 2. Enable more self-service Public sector organizations have stood up self-service options online or at networked kiosks for citizens and students, such as renewing a vehicle registration or meal card online. This makes for more efficient operations \u2013 Deloitte research shows in-person transactions are 100 times more costly than web-based self-service transactions. Self-service transactions can be developed by analyzing website search behavior to see what citizens and students are searching for, commonly used keywords, and the most clicked search results. These analyses can even be done in real-time with search dashboards and visualizations that illustrate website search activity. 3. Streamline ecommerce From activating disability benefits to making federal student aid payments, citizens and students transact with public sector organizations online every day. Similar to consumer experiences, users add items to a shopping cart, and then check out when ready. Ecommerce on public sector sites is often a no frills activity, but that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be augmented with search. The ecommerce experience can be personalized by geography with faceted search that adds filters to refine search results with attributes such as jurisdiction, mandates, and more. Curations can also be added so that certain content can be promoted during peak times, such as tax season or hunting season. Shopping cart suggestions, such as registering to vote while renewing a driver\u2019s license, can also be added to make the website visit as productive as possible. 4. Foster transparency Transparency and trust are continually top of mind for government and educational institutions, so much so that Forrester predicts that many organizations will add Chief Trust Officers to their executive leadership teams.", "name": "5 ways search can modernize digital experiences in public sector", "title": "5 ways search can modernize digital experiences in public sector | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-03-16", "byline": ["Suzzanna Martinez"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/search-can-modernize-digital-experiences-in-public-sector-government"}
{"body_content_window": " A key way that public sector organizations provide transparency and build trust is by providing access to public records that citizens can peruse. Whether people are searching for public records related to their personal affairs or for government records through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), they interact with repositories containing millions of records. Their search experience can be vastly improved with applications of natural language processing and vector search that interpret context beyond keywords and deliver relevant results. This also enhances the speed and performance of searches. 5. Boost employee productivity According to Wakefield Research, 85% of employees spend time searching for documents during the workday. That is a lot of wasted time when skilled employees could be doing more meaningful and strategic work. Search that scales across the enterprise can boost productivity by helping employees easily and securely find information across all of your organization\u2019s content sources. This includes documents, PDFs, spreadsheets, wiki pages, development sandboxes, support tickets, and secure information employees have permission to access based on their role or user group. For best results, an enterprise search bar can be dropped in your enterprise intranet to make adoption easy. You may also personalize search with pre-built or custom API integrations, and secure search access by role, user groups, and content source, including cloud-based applications.

It surfaces context such as total unique users and successful/failed authentications, and provides quick access to user events, anomalies, and alerts. The User Details page provides a comprehensive view of an individual user, including key attributes, observed activity, and related anomalies and alerts. A related flyout arms analysts in the flow of a hunt or investigation with relevant user context, including account details and anomalous activity. Examine process executions with Session View Elastic Security 8.2 streamlines triage and investigation workflows with Session View, a new interface for examining process executions on Linux systems that provides a forensic view of system workloads. It helps analysts understand user and service behavior, reconstructing sessions as if peering at the terminal of an adversary attempting to sudo and curl their way to paydirt or a script configured to open a socket connection to a C2C server. An analyst can see, for example, if a reverse shell has been initiated from bash or if a compromised web server is exfiltrating sensitive resources over a freshly opened network socket. Selecting an event surfaces further details, including context on related processes, hosts, and alerts. The release also introduces Linux host event collection via eBPF \u2014 the magic behind Session View \u2014 providing richer visibility into the kernel activity of Linux infrastructure and endpoints than previously possible. For older kernel versions, the solution is backwards compatible. Accelerate alert triage with richer context Elastic Security 8.2 enables analysts triaging an alert to quickly ascertain how many alerts within a given timeframe share a specific attribute, such as an impacted user or host. Knowing how many alerts are associated with the same host, user, IP address \u2014 you name it \u2014 helps them accurately identify alerts meriting investigation and spot opportunities to reduce false positives by honing a detection rule. Accelerating triage with insights on alert attributes benefits downstream SecOps processes, too \u2014 enabling responders to focus on high-priority alerts and reducing adversary dwell times. From this same flyout, analysts can now quickly access links to all cases to which an alert has been linked, accelerating triage and investigation.

The guides cover why an alert fired, how to determine whether it represents a true threat rather or merely a false positive, which steps to consider taking for investigation and remediation, and more. The investigation guides added in this release primarily buttress rules for detecting threats against Windows systems. With expert advice for defending these ubiquitous systems, they uplevel the contributions of junior analysts and reduce the cognitive load of seasoned practitioners. General availability of threat intelligence Elastic Security continues to make it easy to operationalize threat intelligence \u2014 a critical tool for improving detection coverage \u2014 to tighten investigation and response intervals and enable threat hunting. The solution offers turnkey integrations with seven threat intelligence sources, including open source offerings like MISP and AbuseCH and commercial platforms like Anomali and Recorded Future. With the solution, organizations can leverage threat intelligence for event enrichment, automated detection, alert contextualization, and more. With today\u2019s release, these capabilities enter general availability and enjoy full commercial production support. Stop threats at the endpoint Prevention with custom blocklists Administrators can now configure Elastic Agent to protect high-risk systems by blocking the execution of specific applications or code that should never run. This capability is especially useful for protecting systems with highly predictable activity, such as cloud microservices and physical point-of-sale terminals, and can also help ensure that known malicious files are not accidentally executed by an end user. Organizations with access to highly targeted intelligence about the threats facing organizations like theirs can consider defining blocklists to include particularly concerning malware IoCs. Expanded set of endpoint behavior protections Elastic Security 8.2 further extends the power of malicious behavior protection on Elastic Agent, which pairs post-execution behavior analytics with targeted response actions to stop sophisticated adversaries. These new preventions enhance protection of Windows, macOS, and Linux systems, addressing a broad set of MITRE ATT&CK\u00ae Tactics \u2014 particularly initial access, privilege escalation, and defense evasion. These new protections add to the targeted capabilities for stopping advanced attack techniques featured in our 8.1 announcement . Osquery inspection directly from an Alert Elastic Security 8.2 arms analysts to inspect hosts directly from an alert, putting host context within immediate reach.

The release enhances our support for third-party endpoint security technologies. A new integration for Microsoft 365 Defender enables organizations to collect security events with Elastic Agent, providing an alternative to Filebeat. The release also enables organizations to collect alerts, endpoint events, and watchlist hits from VMware Carbon Black Cloud, building on our support for VMware Carbon Black EDR . With logs for Cisco Secure Email, an email security gateway product designed to detect and block a wide variety of email-borne threats, organizations can enhance protection against malware, spam, and phishing attempts. The release also adds support for Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE), an identity and access control policy platform for endpoints, and updates our integration for the ingestion of logs from Cisco Meraki MX, enhancing visibility across the network layer. Out-of-the-box detection rules Organizations can now spot a broader set of attack techniques targeting user accounts with new prebuilt detection rules. Several of the new rules help stop adversaries from misusing user accounts and privileges by spotting insecure Windows AD configuration practices and related suspicious activity. Recent newsworthy events indicate that these kinds of rules are essential for detecting disruptive activity before it becomes a headline. The new detecction rules help ensure that even adversaries leveraging sophisticated evasion methods can\u2019t create or commandeer a user account and escalate privileges without going unnoticed.

Each agg is roughly seeing only 0.1% of the documents (or 1 in every 1000th document). Where computational cost correlates with the number of documents, the aggregation speed increases. You may have also noticed the \u201c seed \u201d parameter. You can provide a seed to get consistent results on the same shards. Without a seed, a new random subset of documents is considered and you may get slightly different aggregated results. How much faster is the random_sampler ? The speed improves according to the provided probability as fewer documents are aggregated. The improvements relative to probability will eventually flatten out. Each aggregation has its own computational overhead regardless of the number of documents. An example of this overhead cost is comparing multi-bucket to single metric aggregations. Multi-bucket aggregations have a higher overhead due to their bucket handling logic. While speed is improved for multi-bucket aggregations, the rate of that speed increase will flatten out sooner than single metric. Figure 1. The speedup expected for aggregations of different constant overhead. Here are some results on expected speed and error rate over an APM data set of 64 million documents. The calculations are from: 300 query and aggregation combinations, 5 seeds, and 9 sampling probabilities.

The total set loads in seconds and is sampled in milliseconds. This is with almost no discernible visual difference. Figure 4. Sampled vs unsampled document count visualizations. Here is another example. This time the average transaction by hour is calculated and visualized. While visually these are not exactly the same, the overall trends are still evident. For a quick overview of the data to catch trends, sampling works marvelously. Figure 5. Sampled vs. unsampled average transaction time by hour visualization. < - Best practices for using sampling aggregation Sampling shines when you have a large data set. In these cases you might ask, should I sample before the data is indexed in Elasticsearch? Sampling at query time and before ingestion are complimentary. Each has its distinct advantages. When sampling at ingest time, it can save disk and indexing costs. However, if your data has multiple facets, you have to stratify sampling over facets when sampling before ingestion, unless you know exactly how it will be queried. This suffers from the curse of dimensionality and you could end up with underrepresented sets of facets. Furthermore, you have to cater for the worst case when sampling before ingestion. For example, if you want to compute percentiles for two queries, one which matches 50% of the documents and one which matches 1% of documents in an index, you can get away with 7X more downsampling for the first query and achieve the same accuracy. Here is a summary of what to expect from sampling with the random_sampler at query time. Figure 6. Relative error for different aggregations. Sampling accuracy varies across aggregations (see Figure 5 for some examples). Here is a list of some aggregations in order of descending accuracy: percentiles , counts , means , sums , variance , minimum , and maximum . Metric aggregation accuracy will also be affected by the underlying data variation: the lower the variation in the values, the fewer samples you need to get accurate aggregate values. The minimum and maximum will not be reliable with outliers, since there is always a reasonable chance that the sampled set misses the one very large (or small) value in the data set.", "name": "Aggregate data faster with new the random_sampler aggregation", "title": "Aggregate data faster with new the random_sampler aggregation | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-03", "byline": ["Tom Veasey", "Benjamin Trent"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/aggregate-data-faster-with-new-the-random-sampler-aggregation"}
{"body_content_window": " If you are using terms aggregations (or some partitioning such as date histogram), aggregate values for terms (or buckets) with few values will be less accurate or missed altogether. Aggregations also have fixed overheads (see Figure 1 for an example). This means as the sample size decreases, the performance improvement will eventually level out. Aggregations which have many buckets have higher overheads and so the speedup you will gain from sampling is smaller. For example, a terms aggregation for a high cardinality field will show less performance benefit. If in doubt, some simple experiments will often suffice to determine good settings for your data set. For example, suppose you want to speed up a dashboard; try reducing the sample probability while the visualizations look similar enough. Chances are your data characteristics will be stable and so this setting will remain reliable. Uncovering how sampling works Sampling considers the entire document set within a shard. Once it creates the sampled document set, sampling applies any provided user filter. The documents that match the filter and are within the sampled set are then aggregated (see Figure 7). Figure 7. Typical request and data flow for the random_sampler aggregation. The key to the sampling is generating this random subset of the shard efficiently and without statistical biases. Taking geometrically distributed random steps through the document set is equivalent to uniform random sampling, meaning each document in the set has an equally likely chance of being selected into the sample set. The advantage of this approach is that the sampling cost scales with p (where p is the probability configured in the aggregation). This means no matter how small p is, the relative latency of performing the sampling adds will remain fixed. Ensuring performance reliability and accuracy To achieve the highest performance, accuracy, and robustness, we evaluated a range of realistic scenarios. In the case of random_sampler, the evaluation process is complicated by two factors: It cuts right across the aggregation framework and so it needs to be evaluated with many different combinations of query and aggregation, The results are random numbers, so rather than running just once, you need to run multiple times and test the statistical properties of the result set. We began with a proof of concept that showed that the overall strategy worked and the performance characteristics were remarkable. However, there are multiple factors which can affect implementation performance and accuracy. For example, we found the off-the-shelf sampling code for the geometric distribution was not fast enough.", "name": "Aggregate data faster with new the random_sampler aggregation", "title": "Aggregate data faster with new the random_sampler aggregation | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-03", "byline": ["Tom Veasey", "Benjamin Trent"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/aggregate-data-faster-with-new-the-random-sampler-aggregation"}
{"body_content_window": " We decided to roll our own using some tricks to extract more random samples per random bit along with a very fast quantized version of the log function. You also need to be careful that you are generating statistically independent samples for different shards. In summary, as is often the case, the devil is in the details. Undaunted, we wrote a test harness using the Elastic Python client to programmatically generate aggregations and queries, and perform statistical tests of quality. We wanted the approximations we produce to be unbiased. This means if you run a sampled aggregation repeatedly and averaged the results it would converge towards the true value. Standard machinery allows you to test if there is statistically significant evidence of bias. We used a t-test for the difference between the statistic and true value for each aggregation. In over 300 different experiments, the minimum p-value was around 0.0003 which \u2014 given we ran 300 experiments \u2014 has about a 9% odds of occurring by chance. This is a little low, but not enough to worry about; furthermore the median p-value was 0.38. We also tested whether various index properties affect the statistical properties. For example, we wanted to see if we could measure a statistically significant difference between the distribution of results with and without index sorting. A K-S test can be used to check if samples come from the same distribution. In our 300 experiments the smallest p-value was around 0.002 which occurs with odds of about 45% by chance. Get started today We\u2019re not done with this feature yet. Once you have the ability to generate fast approximate results, a key question is: how accurate are those results?

You can also download the Elastic Stack and our cloud orchestration products, Elastic Cloud Enterprise, and Elastic Cloud for Kubernetes, for a self-managed experience. Eliminate blind spots with smarter sampling of transactions As application environments continue to become more complex, many application performance monitoring (APM) customers have faced a trade off between crucial visibility and the performance overhead of collecting complete data from their environment. While sampling and storing every trace would be optimal from an operational standpoint, the overhead and financial cost of doing so would be prohibitive. Many smart sampling methodologies have approached this issue with varying degrees of success. The commonly employed \u201chead-based\u201d decision to sample or not at the time the trace is initiated applies a fixed rate of sampling (for example, sample every 5th trace) to all transactions. Head-based sampling works well and is efficient in lower volume systems due to its simplicity. But this methodology has its weaknesses. The head-based approach can miss critical transactions because it doesn\u2019t take into account questions such as: Did this transaction complete or not? How long did it take to execute? With tail-based sampling, the decision to sample is made after the transaction completes. As such, different sampling rates may be applied based on transaction duration, failure or success, and a higher proportion of \u201cinteresting\u201d transactions can be captured. In high-volume systems with millions of transactions and spans, the weaknesses of head-based sampling become apparent, quickly. Elastic\u2019s new tail-based sampling methodology supplements the head-based approach by giving customers finer grained control over sampling conditions. With tail-based sampling, the decision to keep or discard is made after the trace has completed and been observed.", "name": "Elastic Observability 8.2: Tail-based sampling, plus more serverless visibility for AWS", "title": "Elastic Observability 8.2: Tail-based sampling, plus more serverless visibility for AWS | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-03", "byline": ["Amena Siddiqi"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/whats-new-elastic-observability-8-2-0"}
{"body_content_window": " As such, sampling rates can be applied in accordance with the duration of each sampled transaction. Slower transactions are preferentially collected more frequently than fast ones as they are considered to be more \u201cinteresting.\u201d Each trace is further evaluated against a set of rules or policies, including transaction type, application environment (e.g., prod, test, or staging), and transaction outcome (success or failure). By selectively configuring sampling rates , customers can more efficiently store the most relevant data for their use cases. In today\u2019s complex, high-volume, distributed systems, the ability to pinpoint issues with the granularity provided by tail-based sampling is absolutely necessary. With the tail-based sampling approach, customers can: Maximize visibility while fine tuning the performance overhead of data collection Reduce total cost of ownership (TCO) by capturing and storing only the most important transactions Eliminate blind spots and sleep peacefully knowing that they will never miss an issue Always have all the data they need to detect and troubleshoot problematic transactions Trend and report on business goals and objectives Accelerate troubleshooting for AWS Lambda functions With the 8.2 release, the ability to natively collect serverless traces from AWS Lambda functions is now generally available, providing DevOps and application development teams more detailed end-to-end visibility into distributed transactions that invoke serverless functions.

{"body_content_window": " With an APM data set with 63 million documents, we were able to see up to 80X performance improvement on our count aggregation ! The speed depends on a few factors like volume or data density and probability, but these are within your control. The random sampler utilizes a probability parameter and a seed variable allowing you to customize the speed and accuracy based on the volume and density of your data. This gives you the control and flexibility of the speed and accuracy . Another benefit of randomly sampling documents is the reduced computational overhead regardless of the number of documents being searched. This provides an even greater scale of data to search within Elasticsearch. The random sampler aggregation can be used to accelerate any application that utilizes aggregations for calculations. To learn more about random sampler aggregation including uncovering how sampling works, best practices, and ensuring performance reliability check out the Random Sampling in Elasticsearch blog . Hail to the vectors Vector search - the technology powering the newest breed of search experiences such as image search, generative question answering and semantic search - continues on its fast-evolving journey with the addition of native filtering functionality. U ntil now the HNSW implementation in Lucene supported only a hierarchy of two layers of the graph. In Lucene 9.1 we added the ability to have multiple layers in the hierarchy, and we are using this in Elasticsearch 8.2. The immediate benefits are improved and more stable query latency, as can be seen in the Lucene benchmarks . In 8.2, ANN filtering capability, now in tech preview, provides more effective ways to query data without configuration. Filters in Elasticsearch helped narrow the results from a search by applying conditions in the query string. With support for combining ANN with filters you can ask \u201cWhat are the most similar documents that also satisfy this query?\u201d. With HNSW algorithm, Elasticsearch will automatically determine the best approach to ANN by switching between filtering HNSW or taking a brute force approach. The determining factor is the size of the filtered data result sets. Small data sets are easily filtered with brute force as it compares all data points. For larger datasets filtering HNSW is more optimal as it traverses quicker to find similar vectors.

{"body_content_window": " Reading this out loud, this translates to Trigger a HTTP request only, if there was no typing activity for 500ms Then send a HTTP POST request to /htmx-search While you are waiting, show the .htmx-indicator element. The response should be rendered into the element with the ID #search-results Just think about the sheer amount of javascript you would need for all the logic regarding key listeners, displaying elements to wait for a response or sending the AJAX request. The other big advantage is the fact of being able to use your favourite server side rendering solution to create the HTML being returned. This means, we can stay in the thymeleaf ecosystem instead of having to implement some client side templating language. This makes the htmx-search-results template very simple by just iterating through the results: <div th:each=\"result : ${results}\"> <h4><a th:href=\"${result.url}\" th:text=\"${result.title}\"></a></h4> <blockquote style=\"font-size: 0.7em\" th:text=\"${result.description}\"></blockquote> <hr> </div> One difference to the first example is, that the URL of this search never gets changed, so you cannot bookmark it. Even though there is history support in htmx, I left it out for the sake of this example, as it requires some more careful implementation to do it right.

{"body_content_window": " Well simple, it's one of the possibilities to figure out if your search results are good by measuring if your users clicked them. This is also why there is some more javascript included in this HTML snippet. Let's take a look first, how this looks in Kibana. You can see the Click analytics at the bottom, that have tracked a click after I searched for crystal in the clicked first link. By clicking on that term you can see which document has been clicked and basically follow the click trail of your users. So, how is this implemented in our little app? By using a click javascript listener for certain links. This is the javascript snippet document.addEventListener(\"click\", function(e) { const el = e.target; if (!el.classList.contains(\"track-click\")) return; client.click({ query: el.getAttribute(\"data-query\"), documentId: el.getAttribute(\"data-document-id\"), requestId: el.getAttribute(\"data-request-id\") }); }); If a clicked link has the track-click class, then send a click event using the ElasticAppSearch client. This event contains the original query term, as well as the documentId and requestId , that were part of the search response and were rendered into the <a> element in the template above. We could also add this functionality into the server side rendering, by providing that information when a user clicks a link, so this is not exclusive for the browser at all. For the sake of simplicity I skipped the implementation here.

Defining an interface only for our search client In order to be able to query the App Search endpoint within Spring Boot, all that is needed to be implemented is an interface due to using Feign . We do not have to care for JSON serialization or creating HTTP connections, we can work with POJOs only. This is our definition for our app search client @FeignClient(name = \"appsearch\", url=\"${appsearch.url}\") public interface AppSearchClient { @GetMapping(\"/api/as/v1/engines/${appsearch.engine}/search\") QueryResponse search(@RequestBody Query query); } The client uses the application.properties definitions for the url and engine so that nothing of this needs to be specified as part of the API call. Also, this client uses the headers defined in the application.properties file. This way, no application code contains URLs, engine names or custom auth headers. The only classes requiring more implementation are Query to model the request body and QueryResponse modelling the request response. I have opted to only model the absolutely needed fields in the response, even though it usually contains much more JSON. Whenever I need more data, I could add it to the QueryResponse class. The query class only consists of the query field for now public class Query { private final String query; public Query(String query) { this.query = query; } public String getQuery() { return query; } public static Query of(String query) { return new Query(query); } } Read more So, finally, let's run some searches from within the application.", "name": "Using Spring Boot with Elastic App Search", "title": "Using Spring Boot with Elastic App Searchd | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-04-15", "byline": ["Alexander Reelsen"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/using-spring-boot-with-elastic-app-search"}
{"body_content_window": " Server side queries and rendering The sample application implements three models of querying the App Search instance and integrating it within the Spring Boot Application. The first one sends a search term to the Spring Boot App, which sends the query to App Search and then renders the results via thymeleaf, the standard rendering dependency in Spring Boot. This is the controller @Controller @RequestMapping(path = \"/\") public class MainController { private final AppSearchClient appSearchClient; public MainController(AppSearchClient appSearchClient) { this.appSearchClient = appSearchClient; } @GetMapping(\"/\") public String main(@RequestParam(value = \"q\", required = false) String q, Model model) { if (q != null && q.trim().isBlank() == false) { model.addAttribute(\"q\", q); final QueryResponse response = appSearchClient.search(Query.of(q)); model.addAttribute(\"results\", response.getResults()); } return \"main\"; } } Read more Looking at the main() method there is a check for the q parameter.

The code initializes two variables to be used <div layout:fragment=\"content\" x-data=\"{ q: '', response: null }\"> The q variable will contain the query of the input form and the response will contain the response from a search. The next interesting part is the form definition <form @submit.prevent=\"\"> <input type=\"search\" autocomplete=\"off\" placeholder=\"Search Articles...\" x-model=\"q\" @keyup=\"client.search(q).then(resultList => response = resultList)\"> </form> Using <input x-model=\"q\"...> binds the q variable to the input and is updated whenever the user types. There is also an event for `keyup` to execute a search using client.search() and assign the outcome to the response variable. So once the client search returns, the response variable won't be empty anymore. Lastly, using @submit.prevent=\"\" ensures that the form is not submitted. Next up all the <template> tags, that are rendered once the response is set and iterates through the response.results list. For each element, the following HTML snippet is rendered <div> <h4><a class=\"track-click\" :data-request-id=\"response.info.meta.request_id\" :data-document-id=\"result.data.id.raw\" :data-query=\"q\" :href=\"result.data.url.raw\" x-text=\"result.data.title.raw\"> </a></h4> <blockquote style=\"font-size: 0.7em\" x-text=\"result.data.meta_description.raw\"></blockquote> <hr> </div> Read more This rendering is slightly different from the two server side rendering implementations, because it contains added functionality to track clicked links.

It\u2019s ready for you to run terraform and get up and running in no time. git clone https://github.com/spinscale/spring-boot-app-search In order to have an example up and running, we have to create an API key in Elastic Cloud as described in the terraform provider setup .", "name": "Using Spring Boot with Elastic App Search", "title": "Using Spring Boot with Elastic App Searchd | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-04-15", "byline": ["Alexander Reelsen"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/using-spring-boot-with-elastic-app-search"}

After a few minutes you should see your instance in the Elastic Cloud UI up and running like this Configuring the Spring Boot application Before we continue, let's make sure we can build and run the Java application. All you need is Java 17 installed, and you can go ahead and run ./gradlew clean check This will download all the dependencies, run the tests and fail . This is expected, as we have not indexed any data into our app search instance. Before we can do that we have to change the configuration and index some data. Let's start with changing the configuration by editing the src/main/resources/application.properties file (the snippet below only shows the parameters that require changing! ): appsearch.url=https://dc3ff02216a54511ae43293497c31b20.ent-search.westeurope.azure.elastic-cloud.com appsearch.engine=web-crawler-search-engine appsearch.key=search-untdq4d62zdka9zq4mkre4vv feign.client.config.appsearch.defaultRequestHeaders.Authorization=Bearer search-untdq4d62zdka9zq4mkre4vv If you do not want to enter any password to log into Kibana, you log into the Kibana instance via the Elastic Cloud UI and then go to Enterprise Search > App Search You can extract the appsearch.key and feign... search parameter from the Credentials page within App Search. The same applies for the Endpoint which is shown right at the top. Now, when running ./gradlew clean check the correct App Search endpoint is hit, but the tests keep failing as we still have not indexed any data. Let's do that now!

{"body_content_window": " There are no tools helping developers to clearly understand which path their code took while running in the Linux kernel, which code regions, or, even better, code branches are uncovered, and maybe why. That's why I sat down and wrote bpfcov : a tool to gather source-based coverage info for our eBPF programs running in the Linux kernel. Whether they are getting loaded via BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN or by other ordinary means. Until today, there was no simple way to visualize how the flow of your eBPF program running in the kernel was. Hopefully, there is one starting today. So, let's jump straight into the topic. Source-based code coverage for eBPF Everyone reading this post probably knows what the code coverage is. Common line-level coverage gives us a sense of what line is executed. In some cases, it even tells us how many times a line got executed. When building this tool, driven by my experience fighting with BPF, I knew I wanted something more. Line-level granularity is often too coarse. We do not want an approximation of what code actually executed. We need something more precise to understand the execution path of our eBPF programs in the Linux kernel. We even want to know what part of an `if` conditional executed. Source-based code coverage is what I wanted for this reason. Since it starts at code generation time in LLVM, it has the notion of regions of the code, branches, and so on. It even precisely counts things like short-circuited conditionals, thanks to the counter expression and arithmetics between them. It generates coverage summaries with very fined-grained code regions, helping us find grasps in the code and its execution flow. So, given eBPF programs are usually written in C, couldn\u2019t we just instrument them for source-based code coverage as we would commonly do with Clang for our C programs? I bet this is the first argument pumping into the head of many readers. It also was one of my thoughts when approaching this problem. Turns out that we definitely can, and we will do it. But it won\u2019t work as is.", "name": "Code coverage for eBPF programs", "title": "Code coverage for eBPF programs | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-02-03", "byline": ["Leonardo Di Donato"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/code-coverage-for-ebpf-programs"}
{"body_content_window": " To understand why it won\u2019t work, we need to keep in mind that BPF programs are compiled via Clang (thanks to the LLVM BPF target ) to BPF ELF object files, containing instructions specific to the chosen BPF instruction set, which need to be later loaded in the Linux kernel via the bpf() syscall. Furthermore, it\u2019s paramount to mention that the BPF programs will be verified by an in-kernel verifier and then executed by the BPF VM. Such a lifecycle and environment imposes a set of constraints that make it infeasible to get them working with the plain instrumentation that LLVM applies to get source-based code coverage. In fact, when compiling a C program for source-based coverage with the -fprofile-instr-generate and -fcoverage-mapping Clang flags, LLVM instruments it with a bunch of global variables and, in some cases, functions. Observing the LLVM IR of a C program after compiling it with the -fprofile-instr-generate flag, we can notice that, LLVM\u2026 defines the counters, in the form of __profc_<function_name> private global arrays whose size is the number of counters needed to cover all the regions and branches of such a function marks those counters to be into the `__llvm_prf_cnts` section of the ELF defines (and initializes) __profd_<function_name> private global struct instances that contains an identifier of the function, the pointer to its counters, the pointer to the function itself, the number of the counters for the target function, and a bunch of other info needed to tie together the counters and the coverage mappings marks the __profd_ globals to end up into the __llvm_prf_data section of the ELF defines (and initializes) a private constant ( __llvm_prf_nm ) containing the names of the target functions marks the names constant to end up in the __llvm_prf_names section of the ELF The first issue to dismount here is that we can't have random ELF sections (like __llvm_prf_cnts , etc.) into valid BPF ELF files.", "name": "Code coverage for eBPF programs", "title": "Code coverage for eBPF programs | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-02-03", "byline": ["Leonardo Di Donato"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/code-coverage-for-ebpf-programs"}
{"body_content_window": " We know that we can have eBPF global constants with a scalar type like __profc_ ones, at least on recent Linux kernels. At the same time, we know it's not wise to have global structs like __profd_ or whatever loader for our eBPF programs we will write, as we'll need the struct definitions. Too clunky. The -fprofile-instr-generate flag also generates a global constructor and a set of global functions, all prefixed with __llvm_profile , intended to set up the profiling runtime in the resulting binary so that when it dies or exits it will automatically generate a profraw file. Here we meet another stumbling block to overcome. The BPF verifier will refuse our BPF ELF containing strange global functions, not to mention \"constructors\"... We need to get rid of them and replace their functionality with a feasible approach for BPF. Clearly, LLVM also patches our instructions in the right spots, by placing the counters and incrementing them. As you can see in the following annotated screenshot: If you write an eBPF program incrementing a counter (defined as an eBPF global variable) you will notice that the resulting instructions will be like those here in the screenshot. It means we can keep these the way they are generated by LLVM and let it do all its magic without interfering at the instructions level. Finally, some good news! Instead, focusing on the -fcoverage-mapping Clang flag and inspecting the LLVM IR it outputs, we notice that it\u2026 defines (and initializes) __covrec_ global (constant) structs, most notably containing the same ID that the __profd_ variables contain, and a LEB128 encoded string containing all the region, branches, and generally the coverage mapping info defines (and initializes) a __llvm_coverage_mapping function containing meta info about the coverage mapping format (eg., the version), and the source file names marks the __llvm_coverage_mapping variable to be put into the __llvm_covmap section of the ELF In this case, we have the same category of issues mentioned before.", "name": "Code coverage for eBPF programs", "title": "Code coverage for eBPF programs | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-02-03", "byline": ["Leonardo Di Donato"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/code-coverage-for-ebpf-programs"}
{"body_content_window": " We need to keep at least the header of __llvm_coverage_mapping because it contains the coverage mappings version, which we need for generating a valid profraw file. Also, we need to put it in a BPF. Luckily, we can remove the __covrec_ structs from the BPF ELF meant to be loaded in the kernel. We can keep them in a second BPF ELF that would be intended to be given to tools needing the coverage mappings for generating the coverage reports, just like llvm-cov does. How it's done libBPFCov.so - A LLVM pass By analyzing the resulting LLVM IR for source-based coverage instrumented programs, we should now have a better understanding of what we need to do for having it on eBPF programs running in the Linux kernel. We now know what to completely get rid of and do differently, and what we need to patch to make it loadable and usable by the BPF VM in the kernel. The plan is simple: get Clang to instrument a BPF LLVM intermediate representation for source-based code coverage, then patch it to model it into a valid representation for BPF ELF. How do we need to transform it? First of all, we are so lucky we don\u2019t have to mess with the actual BPF instructions \u2014 namely the counters increments. We can keep them the way they are. This is a huge win because we let LLVM keep track of the global state of the registers and we avoid a lot of work this way. But for sure we have to strip any profile initialization stuff that Clang creates, things like __llvm_profile_runtime and __llvm_profile_init - when present - are no good for the BPF VM in the kernel. We also want to ensure the global variables, whether constants or not, have the right visibility (ie., dso_local ) and linkage, to have them in the libbpf skeletons if we plan to use them. For the global structs that we need for generating the profraw files, namely the __profd_ variables, we just transform them into different and single global variables, one for each field. For example, this is what I did for the __profd_* variables which originally are a struct with 7 fields.", "name": "Code coverage for eBPF programs", "title": "Code coverage for eBPF programs | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-02-03", "byline": ["Leonardo Di Donato"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/code-coverage-for-ebpf-programs"}
{"body_content_window": " For other global structs like the __covrec_ ones, we can just strip them from the BPF ELF that is meant to be loaded in the kernel. Anyway, the report generation phase (ie., llvm-cov or bpfcov out ) will need them for knowing at which line and column a code region or a branch starts. For this reason, I decided to give the LLVM pass an option (enabled with the strip-initializers-only flag) that keeps them, so we can later create a BPF ELF that is only meant for this phase and not for loading. This BPF ELF will have .bpf.obj as an extension, rather than .bpf.o . Finally, we know that libbpf supports (on recent Linux kernels) eBPF global variables, which are simply eBPF maps with one single value, and we are planning to use them. But, as already mentioned, it does not accept or recognize the ELF sections that the Clang instrumentation injects in the intermediate representation. So we need our LLVM pass to change them to custom eBPF sections . The eBPF custom sections are in the form of .rodata. * or .data. * made to contain static and/or global data. We can change the section of the counters to be .data.profc . The section of the __llvm_prf_nm from _llvm_prf_names to .rodata.profn , and so on. You can find all this logic summarized in these bits of code . So, assuming the following dummy eBPF program: I think that the following snippet tells everything about what we obtain from the libBPFCov.so LLVM pass: For example, you may notice that we have 2 __profc_ counters. The first is for the BPF_PROG macro that expands to a function, the second for the actual BPF raw tracepoint program hook_sys_enter . This one has size 3. That\u2019s because the hook_sys_enter function has 3 main regions: the entry of the function, the if conditional, and the for cycle.", "name": "Code coverage for eBPF programs", "title": "Code coverage for eBPF programs | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-02-03", "byline": ["Leonardo Di Donato"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/code-coverage-for-ebpf-programs"}
{"body_content_window": " You may also notice that the LLVM pass, for each one of the 2 functions we have, split the __profd_ global structs into 7 different global variables in the .rodata.profd section. Someone who has an eye for it may also have noticed that the third field of __profd_ \u2014 now __profd_something.2 \u2014 does not contain anymore the address of its counters. I didn\u2019t want (nor I could) to expose kernel addresses, so I put here the offset of the counters in their section ( .data.profc ). Finally, you can also see that, as anticipated before, we completely deleted the __covrec_ global constant structs from this IR that\u2019s meant to generate a valid and loadable BPF ELF. While the instructions incrementing the counters in the correct spots are not touched at all. So we don\u2019t need another screenshot to show them! The only missing moving part is how to generate a valid profraw file. We stripped any logic for doing it. We know that for generating it we need all the globals we left in this LLVM intermediate representation. But we have no sane way to hook the exit or the stop of an eBPF program in the Linux kernel. Suddenly, inspiration came: let\u2019s pin the globals to the BPF file system so that we can decouple the process of generating the profraw file from the running (and exiting) of the instrumented eBPF application! And that\u2019s what the bpfcov CLI does. Before moving to the next section, I suggest you go to the bpfcov repository and start building the pass to obtain libBPFCov.so . You can find the instructions on how to build it here . Instrument your eBPF program Now that we have built libBPFCov.so we can finally take action! Instrumenting an eBPF program for source-based coverage is not that different than compiling it normally with Clang and the BPF target. The only difference is that we ask Clang to output LLVM IR (either in textual or binary form), run the libBPFCov.so pass on it (with opt ), and finally compile it (with llc ) to a BPF ELF.", "name": "Code coverage for eBPF programs", "title": "Code coverage for eBPF programs | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-02-03", "byline": ["Leonardo Di Donato"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/code-coverage-for-ebpf-programs"}

We now have a valid and coverage instrumented BPF ELF: cov/raw_enter.bpf.o . From now on, you can instruct your loader and userspace code to use it, so to obtain a binary (eg., /cov/raw_enter ) that is your eBPF application. Use it bpfcov run + bpfcov gen What's left to do? Just three steps: Run our eBPF application with the bpfcov CLI run command Generate its profraw file Generate beautiful source-based coverage reports So, let's run our eBPF application with: bash sudo ./bpfcov -v2 run cov/raw_enter This command acts similar to strace. It will detect the bpf() syscalls with the BPF_MAP_CREATE command. Meaning that it will detect the eBPF globals in the .profc , .profd , .profn , and .covmap custom eBPF sections and pin them to the BPF file system, as you can see in the following screenshot. You may also notice that - since the LLVM pass annotated the counters correctly - libbpf can collect relocations for them\u2026 At this point, whether we stopped our eBPF application or it exited\u2026 We have eBPF maps pinned to our BPF file system.", "name": "Code coverage for eBPF programs", "title": "Code coverage for eBPF programs | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-02-03", "byline": ["Leonardo Di Donato"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/code-coverage-for-ebpf-programs"}
{"body_content_window": " Let\u2019s check it: Wonderful, we already know that the hook_sys_enter function executed one time, the if condition did not evaluate to true, while the for iterated nine times! It\u2019s time to put the counters, the function names, the functions data, in a profraw file now. This is why I created the bpfcov gen command exists: to dump the pinned maps in a profraw file. shell sudo ./bpfcov -v2 gen \u2013unpin cov/raw_enter And this is the resulting profraw file for our instrumented eBPF program! You can see it\u2019s made of four parts: a header, .rodata.profd , .data.profc (ie., the counters! ), and the names ( .rodata.profn ), plus some padding for alignment\u2026 We can now either use the existing LLVM tools ( llvm-profdata and llvm-cov ) with it or simply use the out subcommand. The bpfcov out command is an opinionated shortcut to generate HTML, JSON, or LCOV coverage reports even from multiple eBPF programs and their profraw files. It is very convenient because it avoids us having to generate profdata from the profraw , calling llvm-cov with a bunch of long and different options. And it even works with multiple profraw files coming from different eBPF applications\u2026 shell ./bpfcov out -o yey \u2013f html \\ cov/raw_enter.profraw \u2026 It outputs a very nice HTML directory whose index file gives us summaries not only about function and line coverage but also and notably about region and branch coverages for our eBPF applications. By clicking on any item in the table we end up visualizing very fine-grained, source-based coverage. A good example is the one in the following image: Furthermore, it does work also on very complicated and real-life eBPF programs. For example, the following screenshot is a part of the coverage report obtained for a BPF LSM test ( progs/lsm.c , loaded by prog_tests/test_lsm.c ) living in the Linux kernel.", "name": "Code coverage for eBPF programs", "title": "Code coverage for eBPF programs | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-02-03", "byline": ["Leonardo Di Donato"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/code-coverage-for-ebpf-programs"}
{"body_content_window": " Thanks to this tool I can finally understand that over a total of eight executions of the lsm/file_mprotect BPF LSM program on my kernel, its is_stack variable was true two times out of eight, because six times the vma->vm_end >= vma->vm_mm->start_stack branch condition (98:58) evaluated to false. Line 100, using is_stack in another condition, confirms that it was indeed true two times out of six. And that, for this reason (first operand - 100:6 - is_stack being false six times), the following check (100:18) on monitored_pid was short-circuited and evaluated (to true, by the way) only two times.

Bits on the future The bpfcov tool is open-source, and it will stay that way. It is still in its early days so it will probably need a bit more tests, examples, and fixes.

{"body_content_window": " Irrespective of how users elect to put their data to work, users who upgrade to Elastic 8.2 can get faster search results and accelerated insights thanks to the new random sampler aggregation, multiple enhancements to Elasticsearch\u2019s vector search capabilities, and the general availability of Discover\u2019s new data exploration tools in Kibana. Whether it\u2019s connecting people and teams with content that matters, optimizing mission-critical applications and infrastructure, or protecting your digital ecosystem from cyber threats, Elastic 8.2 is available to help everyone reach new levels of success. A common search language, complete interoperability arrives Elastic 8.2 makes it easy to use Enterprise Search\u2019s time-saving relevance-tuning and analytics tools with existing Elasticsearch indices without the need to migrate or update data structures. Keep everything from data ingestion pipelines to data lifecycle management policies in place, and use Enterprise Search\u2019s pre-configured tooling to quickly bring new search experiences to market. This means faster deployments, more straightforward relevance management, and better visibility into end-user search behavior across your applications, websites, and enterprise. In addition, Elastic 8.2 delivers a new capability to use Elasticsearch query syntax for any Enterprise Search engine. Perform advanced aggregations, use different query-time analysis chains, and design complex filtering logic against content originally created via Enterprise Search \u2014 all without compromising on baseline relevance and analytics collection. To learn more about how Elastic Enterprise Search is evolving with the Elastic 8.2 release, check out the Elastic Enterprise Search 8.2 blog . Streamline cloud-native troubleshooting and data ingestion As organizations move workloads to the cloud and begin to adopt microservices based architectures, application environments continue to become increasingly complex. Given highly distributed, high-volume systems, many application performance monitoring (APM) users have had to decide between \u201ccomplete visibility\u201d and the performance overhead associated with collecting complete data from their environment. Collecting traces using the commonly employed head-based decision to sample (or not) at the time a trace is initiated fails to take into account critical factors, including if the transaction completed (or not) and how long it took to execute. With head-based sampling methodologies, should a user need complete visibility \u2014 they would also need to capture and store every single trace. The solution is tail-based sampling. With tail-based sampling the decision to keep or discard a given trace is made after the trace has completed.", "name": "Build seamless search-powered customer experiences with Elastic 8.2", "title": "Build seamless, search-powered customer experiences with Elastic 8.2 | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-03", "byline": ["Dan Courcy"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/whats-new-elastic-8-2-0"}
{"body_content_window": " As such, each trace can be evaluated against a set of rules or policies, and sampling traces can be fine-tuned to the duration or failure status of each transaction. In this way, storing every single trace is not required for complete visibility and easier troubleshooting. Elastic\u2019s new tail-based sampling methodology gives users finer grained control over sampling conditions. It enables users to selectively configure sampling rates and to efficiently store only the most relevant data for their use cases. By capturing the most important transactions, customers can sleep peacefully knowing that they will always have all the data they need to detect and troubleshoot problematic transactions without the burden of excessive overhead. In addition, Elastic 8.2 continues to streamline ingestion from AWS data sources \u2014 giving customers greater visibility into their cloud-based applications and infrastructure. To learn more about how Elastic 8.2 is helping to maximize visibility via support for AWS Lambda function traces, new Amazon S3 and CloudWatch custom logs integrations, and the new Elastic Serverless Forwarder input sources, check out the Elastic Observability 8.2 blog . Streamline analyst workflows with context and expertise Elastic Security 8.2 powers the efficiency and effectiveness of security teams, arming analysts with insights about their organization and the attacks targeting it. Practitioners triaging an alert can now quickly ascertain how many alerts within a given timeframe share a specific attribute, such as an impacted user or host. This context further equips them to accurately identify alerts meriting investigation and spot opportunities to reduce false positives. This release further helps security teams triage, investigate, and respond to alerts with a new set of investigation guides for nearly 100 prebuilt detection rules. Elastic threat researchers help practitioners decide how to address an alert by developing this rule-specific expertise and surfacing it alongside associated alerts. The guides cover why an alert has fired, whether it\u2019s a true threat or a false positive, which steps to consider taking for investigation and remediation, and more. The investigation guides added in this release primarily buttress rules for detecting threats against Windows systems. With expert advice for defending these ubiquitous systems, they uplevel the contributions of junior analysts and reduce the cognitive load of seasoned practitioners.

{"body_content_window": " Elastic Stack and Elastic Cloud: your platform for faster search results and accelerated insights As the foundation for each of our search-powered solutions, everybody wins with enhancements to the Elastic Stack and Elastic Cloud. Let\u2019s start with Elasticsearch, the heart of the Elastic Stack. Elastic 8.2 continues to deliver on speed, scale, relevance, and simplicity with a technical preview of three exciting new features: random sampler aggregation, Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) multi-layer hierarchy, and support for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search with filtering. The new random sampler aggregation exponentially accelerates aggregations (with only a slight trade off in terms of accuracy) by randomly sampling data for a given query (i.e. only a random subset of documents are used to return search results). In terms of vector search, the technology powering the newest breed of search experiences (such as image search, generative question answering, and semantic search), it continues on its fast-evolving journey with an improved HNSW search algorithm and the addition of native filtering functionality. With Elastic 8.2, Elasticsearch uses the same (HNSW) methodology as used in Elastic 8.0 , but with multiple map layers which results in even faster query performance. With Elastic 8.1 , Elastic\u2019s take on approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) brought widely improved performance to production workloads. With Elastic 8.2, the addition of a new filtering capability provides a more effective way to query data with increased precision and control \u2014 ensuring absolute accuracy for consumers looking for a specific answer, result, or product. These incremental investments to vector search support a broader way to understand intent, interpret query signals, and deliver a more precise and immersive experience for end users. Now, let\u2019s talk about Kibana, the tool for visualizing and exploring your data with ease. With Elastic 8.2 comes the general availability of Discover\u2019s new data exploration tools in Kibana. These enhancements help users to get a better understanding of their data from \u201ca bird\u2019s eye view\u201d and then easily zoom in to find anomalies and troubleshoot issues. In addition, Kibana now includes field statistics, in beta. Field statistics enable users to jumpstart their analysis by spotting outliers, understanding the distribution of values, and getting a complete picture of their data landscape in a single view.", "name": "Build seamless search-powered customer experiences with Elastic 8.2", "title": "Build seamless, search-powered customer experiences with Elastic 8.2 | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-03", "byline": ["Dan Courcy"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/whats-new-elastic-8-2-0"}

{"body_content_window": " If you use Docker, you need to execute the following command: docker pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.1.0 Once you have the Docker image installed, you can execute Elasticsearch using a single-node cluster configuration, as follows: docker network create elastic docker run --name es01 --net elastic -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -it docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.1.0 This command creates an elastic Docker network and starts Elasticsearch using the port 9200 (default). When you run the Docker image, a password is generated for the Elastic user and it's printed to the terminal (you might need to scroll back a bit in the terminal to view it). You have to copy it to connect to Elasticsearch. Now that Elasticsearch is running, we can get the http_ca.crt file certificate. Copy it from the Docker instance using the following command: docker cp es01:/usr/share/elasticsearch/config/certs/http_ca.crt . Once we have the http_ca.crt certificate and the password, copied during the start of Elasticsearch, we can use it to connect as follows: $client = ClientBuilder::create() ->setHosts(['https://localhost:9200']) ->setBasicAuthentication('elastic', 'password copied during ES start') ->setCABundle('path/to/http_ca.crt') ->build(); Use the client in asynchronous mode The PHP client offered the possibility to execute asynchronous calls for each endpoint.", "name": "Introducing the new PHP client for Elasticsearch 8", "title": "Introducing the new PHP client for Elasticsearch 8 | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-13", "byline": ["Enrico Zimuel"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-the-new-php-client-for-elasticsearch-8"}
{"body_content_window": " With version 7, you needed to specify a special future => lazy value in the client key passed as parameter for the endpoint, as follows: $params = [ 'index' => 'my-index', 'client' => [ 'future' => 'lazy' ], 'body' => [ 'foo' => 'bar' ] ]; $response = $client->index($params); The previous example indexes the { \"foo\": \"bar\" } document in Elasticsearch using an asynchronous HTTP call. The $response is a future , rather than the actual response. A future represents a future computation and acts like a placeholder. You can pass a future around your code like a regular object. When you need the result values, you can resolve the future. If the future has already been resolved (due to some other activity), the values are immediately available. If the future has not been resolved yet, the resolution blocks until those values become available (for example, after the API call completes). In version 7, the future is actually a Promise of the RingPHP project. In version 8, if you want to use asynchronous, you need to install the specific adapter for your HTTP client. For instance, if you are using Guzzle 7 (the default HTTP library for elasticsearch-php), you need to install the php-http/guzzle7-adapter as follows: composer require php-http/guzzle7-adapter To execute an endpoint using an asynchronous call, you need to enable it using the Client::setAsync(true) function, as follows: $client->setAsync(true); $params = [ 'index' => 'my-index', 'body' => [ 'foo' => 'bar' ] ]; $response = $client->index($params); If you want to disable async for the next endpoint, you need to setAsync to false again. The response of an asynchronous call is a Promise object of the HTTPlug library. This Promise follows the Promises/A+ standard. A promise represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. To get the response, you need to wait for that response to arrive.", "name": "Introducing the new PHP client for Elasticsearch 8", "title": "Introducing the new PHP client for Elasticsearch 8 | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-13", "byline": ["Enrico Zimuel"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-the-new-php-client-for-elasticsearch-8"}
{"body_content_window": " This will block the execution waiting for the response as follows: $response = $client->index($params); $response = $response->wait(); printf(\"Body response:\\n%s\\n\", $response->asString()); The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its then method, which registers callbacks to receive either a promise\u2019s eventual value or the reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled. $response = $client->index($params); $response->then( // The success callback function (ResponseInterface $response) { // $response is Elastic\\Elasticsearch\\Response\\Elasticsearch printf(\"Body response:\\n%s\\n\", $response->asString()); }, // The failure callback function (\\Exception $exception) { echo 'Houston, we have a problem'; throw $exception; } ); $response = $response->wait(); Read more The last $response->wait() is needed to resolve the execution call in the example above. Less code and memory usage The new PHP client for Elasticsearch uses less code compared with version 7. In particular, the elasticsearch-php version 8 is composed of 6,522 lines of code + 1,025 lines of code of elastic-transport-php for a total of 7,547 lines. In version 7, we had 20,715 lines of code, so the new version 8 is about one-third the size of the previous. Regarding the memory usage, elasticsearch-php version 8 implements a lazy loading mechanism to optimize the API namespace loading. This means if you are using only a subset of all the 400+ endpoints, you will not load in memory all the specifications. Wrapping up Elasticsearch 8 comes with some exciting improvements. From the new architecture and the ability to preserve backward compatibility with version 7, to the default security settings and advantages of asynchronous mode, the possibilities have never been more endless.

Along with adopting the PSR standards, we\u2019ve also redesigned the architecture and moved the HTTP transport layer outside. A pluggable system is also now available, thanks to the HTTPlug library. Read on to explore: The new architecture and features of the PHP client How to consume the endpoints and manage errors using the PSR-7 standard for HTTP messages How to interact with Elasticsearch using an asynchronous approach The old client The elasticsearch-php library is the official client for programming Elasticsearch with PHP. This library exposes all the 400+ endpoints of Elasticsearch using a main Client class.", "name": "Introducing the new PHP client for Elasticsearch 8", "title": "Introducing the new PHP client for Elasticsearch 8 | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-13", "byline": ["Enrico Zimuel"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-the-new-php-client-for-elasticsearch-8"}
{"body_content_window": " In version 7 of this library, all the endpoints are exposed using functions \u2014 for example, the index API is mapped into the method Client::index(). These functions return an associative array that is the deserialization of the HTTP response from Elasticsearch. Usually, this response is represented by a JSON message. This message is converted into an array using the json_decode() function of PHP. In case of errors, the client throws an exception that depends on the issue. For instance, if the HTTP response is 404, the client throws a Missing404Exception . If you want to retrieve the HTTP response itself, you need to get the last response from the client using the following code: $response = $client->info(); $last = $client->transport->getLastConnection()->getLastRequestInfo(); $request = $last['request']; // associative array of the HTTP request var_dump($request); $response = $last['response']; // associative array of the HTTP response echo $response['status']; // 200 echo $response['body']; // the body as string The HTTP request and response are retrieved from the transport layer (a property of the Client) with a couple of methods: getLastConnection() and getLastRequestInfo(). This code does not offer a good developer experience because the keys of the associative array $response are quite a lot, coming from the usage of cURL extensions of PHP. The new client We built the new elasticsearch-php 8 from scratch for many reasons: developer experience, new PHP standards, a more open architecture, and performance. With about 70 million installations , we did not want to have many BC breaks for version 8. We used a backward compatibility approach offering the same APIs of version 7. That means you can connect to Elasticsearch using the same code and execute an endpoint call as usual. The difference is in the response. In version 8, the response is an object of Elasticsearch response that implements the PSR-7 response interface and the ArrayAccess interface of PHP. Wait a minute \u2014 isn\u2019t that a big BC break?", "name": "Introducing the new PHP client for Elasticsearch 8", "title": "Introducing the new PHP client for Elasticsearch 8 | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-13", "byline": ["Enrico Zimuel"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-the-new-php-client-for-elasticsearch-8"}
{"body_content_window": " Fortunately, we implemented the ArrayAccess interface and you can continue to consume the response as an array, as follows: Spot the differences: the namespace has been changed! We introduced the Elastic root namespace. The other code looks the same, but there is a big change under the hood. As we mentioned, $response in version 8 is an object, while in version 7 this is an associative array. If you want the exact same behavior of version 7, you can serialize the response as an array using the function $response->asArray(). We also offer asObject() , asString() , and asBool() functions to serialize the body as an object of the standard class of PHP ( stdClass ), as string or boolean (true if 2xx response, false otherwise). For example, you can consume the previous info() endpoint as follows: $client = ClientBuilder::create() ->setHosts(['localhost:9200']) ->build(); $response = $client->info(); echo $response['version']['number']; echo $response->version->number; // 8.0.0 var_dump($response->asObject()); // response body content as stdClass object var_dump($response->asString()); // response body as string (JSON) var_dump($response->asBool()); // true if HTTP response code 2xx Read more The $response is able to access the response body as an object implementing the _get() magic method of PHP. If you want to read the HTTP response, you don\u2019t need to recover the last message from the Client object; you can just access the PSR-7 message in the $response itself, as follows: echo $response->getStatusCode(); // 200, since $response is PSR-7 echo (string) $response->getBody(); // Response body in JSON This is a big advantage, especially if you are working with asynchronous. In fact, you cannot retrieve the last response from the client if you are using asynchronous programming.", "name": "Introducing the new PHP client for Elasticsearch 8", "title": "Introducing the new PHP client for Elasticsearch 8 | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-13", "byline": ["Enrico Zimuel"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-the-new-php-client-for-elasticsearch-8"}
{"body_content_window": " The last response is not guaranteed to be the one that you are looking for (More to come on asynchronous operations later in this article). Endpoint parameters for autocompletion We added an autocompletion capability in elasticsearch-php version 8 using the Object-like arrays of Psalm project. Psalm is a static analysis tool that allows developers to decorate the code using the special phpDoc attribute. One of these attributes is @psalm-type , which makes it possible to specify the key types of an associative array. We applied the Psalm type using the standard phpDoc @param . Each PHP client endpoint has an input parameter that is the $params array. For instance, reported here is the index() endpoint section: /** * Creates or updates a document in an index. * * @see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/docs-index_.html * * @param array{ * id: string, // Document ID * index: string, // (REQUIRED) The name of the index * wait_for_active_shards: string, // Sets the number of shard copies \u2026 * op_type: enum, // Explicit operation type.

The required parameters are specified using a REQUIRED note. You can have autocompletion in your IDE using the previous notation. For instance, using PhpStorm , you can install the deep-assoc-completion free plugin to enable the PHP associative array auto-completion with @psalm-type attribute. The deep-assoc-completion is also available for Visual Studio Code even if this version is still under development. Pluggable architecture Another change we made in version 8 was the split of the HTTP transport layer from the library. We created the elastic-transport-php library that is a PSR-18 client for connecting to Elastic products in PHP. This library is consumed not only by elasticsearch-php but also from other projects like enterprise-search-php . This library is based on a pluggable architecture, which means you can configure it to use a specific implementation of the following interfaces: A PSR-18 client, using ClientInterface A Node pool, using NodePoolInterface A PSR-3 logger, using LoggerInterface The elasticsearch-php version 8 uses the elastic-transport-php as dependency. This means you can connect to Elasticsearch using a custom HTTP library, a custom Node Pool , or a custom logger. We used the HTTPlug library to perform an autodiscovery of the PSR-18 and PSR-7 library available in a PHP application. By default, if the application does not have an HTTP library installed, we use Guzzle .", "name": "Introducing the new PHP client for Elasticsearch 8", "title": "Introducing the new PHP client for Elasticsearch 8 | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-13", "byline": ["Enrico Zimuel"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-the-new-php-client-for-elasticsearch-8"}

Connect to Elastic Cloud Elastic Cloud is the PaaS solution offered by Elastic. To connect to Elastic Cloud, you just need the Cloud ID and the API key . The Cloud ID can be retrieved in the My deployment page of your Elastic Cloud dashboard. The API key can be generated from the Management section in the Security page settings. You can read the Connecting section of the PHP client documentation for more information. Once you have collected the Cloud ID and the API key , you can use elasticsearch-php to connect to your Elastic Cloud instance, as follows: $client = ClientBuilder::create() ->setElasticCloudId('insert here the Cloud ID') ->setApiKey('insert here the API key') ->build(); Security by default If you installed Elasticsearch 8 in your infrastructure, you can use the PHP client with TLS (transport layer security) enabled. Elasticsearch 8 offers security by default , which means it uses TLS to protect the communication between client and server. In order to configure elasticsearch-php to connect to Elasticsearch 8, you need to have the certificate authority file (CA).

{"body_content_window": " About the data This data is a collection of approximately 2 months of gtfs-realtime data streamed from San Antonio, TX. This data consists solely of the vehicle position updates with each bus position updated approximately every 5 min. The data is sparse during off hours (between 00:00-05:00) each day. Each individual bus follows deterministic, daily patterns. These patterns, for certain buses, follow deterministic seasonality that can vary day-to-day. The data consists of 2,882,527 unique events from 24-Apr-2019 to 13-Jun-2019. Data provided by VIA Metropolitan Transit . Creating the anomaly detection job To create an anomaly detection job in Kibana, click Create job on the Machine learning > Anomaly detection page and select the advanced job wizard. Alternatively, use the create anomaly detection jobs API . Use the lat_long function in a detector in your anomaly detection job for the pos field (a geo-point field) and set the by field to vehicle.id. This detects anomalies where the geographic location (pos) of a vehicle (a bus, in this case) is unusual for that particular bus (vehicle.id) . An anomaly might indicate a problem or unforeseen delay. You should then also select vehicle.id as an influencer for this job. For more information regarding influencers, see the documentation . Once you\u2019ve created the job and it has produced some results, you can navigate to Elastic Maps to view them. Mapping anomalies by location in Elastic Maps Navigate to Elastic Maps and select Create Map, then select Add Layer. You should see the ML Anomalies layer card option which you can now select. You can now select from a list of jobs - only jobs with geo location data in the results will be in this list. Once you have a job selected, notice - in the screenshots below - that you can choose between a few layer options: \u2018Actual\u2019 , \u2018Typical\u2019 , and \u2018Actual to typical\u2019 . The \u2018Actual\u2019 layer is displayed by default until another is selected. This layer displays the actual geographical position of the associated entity on the map. As shown in the expanded legend in the above screenshot, the points are colored according to the severity level of the anomaly - this is determined by the record score of the anomaly.", "name": "Elastic Maps now supports the Machine Learning Anomalies Layer", "title": "Elastic Maps now supports the Machine Learning Anomalies Layer | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-17", "byline": ["Melissa Alvarez"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-maps-now-supports-the-machine-learning-anomalies-layer"}

{"body_content_window": " The tooltip for each point will provide more relevant information about the anomaly including the coordinates for both typical and actual positions, record score, and the split field name and value (if there is one). Below, you can see the \u2018Typical\u2019 and \u2018Typical to actual\u2019 layers in action. The \u2018Typical to actual\u2019 layer connects the typical location, found by the analytical modeling, to the actual location with a line to highlight the difference between these locations. It might be useful to view all three layers at once so you can view a vehicle\u2019s actual location alongside the typical location. This might be a bit overwhelming when you\u2019ve got a lot of data to visualize on the map. You may only be interested in anomalies for a particular time frame - iin the screenshot above we are limiting the timeframe to the first week of June 2019 - or with a high record score - indicating they are particularly anomalous. In the screenshot below, with all layers showing in the map, we can filter for anomalies with a record score higher than 95. This allows for a closer look at the buses that are furthest from their typical location for that day and time. Hovering over one of these points, as shown in the image below, you can see in the tooltip the vehicle id of the particular bus - in this case, it\u2019s 4291. You can narrow the results on the map even further to only view anomalies for that vehicle id. Now you can see clearly the actual and expected locations for this bus and can investigate further from there. Link to Maps from Elastic Machine Learning Alternatively, you can now also navigate directly into Elastic Maps from the Anomaly Explorer view in Elastic Machine Learning. This is useful when you\u2019re viewing the results of a job inside the ML app and want to jump directly into Maps with the relevant job and filters already created for you. In the screenshot below, the swim lane cell for vehicle id 4291 has been selected - you can now select the `Open in Maps` link above the embedded map. This will take you directly into Elastic Maps with a filter already in place for that particular vehicle id. Give it a try Want to take Elastic Machine Learning and Maps for a test drive?

Shut It Down days were first announced in April 2020 in response to the global pandemic\u2014we wanted to give our employees space to process what was going on in the world. After two years and overwhelming positive employee feedback, we recently announced that they will continue. Shut It Down days give Elasticians 20+ paid days off in addition to their PTO.

At Elastic we believe in flexibility. In fact, it\u2019s part of our Source Code . We believe in our employees having the flexibility to work and care for their responsibilities at home. For those with a child with autism, those responsibilities outside of work might look a lot different (and more demanding) than yours.

{"body_content_window": " Things are constantly changing While those on the autism spectrum thrive on routine, consistency, and predictability, it\u2019s important to understand that things are constantly changing for them and their families. What worked last year doesn\u2019t work this year. There are new doctors to see, therapies to try, or activities to participate in and they\u2019re not always after work hours. Doctor\u2019s appointments happen during the day, a therapy group might meet at 2pm, or something might come up unexpectedly. There are a lot of decisions that need to be made Due to the increased number of doctors and therapists, there are more decisions to be made about care. And while doctors and therapists can help, parents of the autisic child need to make these decisions by themselves, which can be mentally and emotionally draining. That means that sometimes a work decision may be delegated, because one more decision just can\u2019t be made. Everyone has their own opinions Opinions are great, but everyone has them and shares them. The parents of an autistic child hears solicited and unsolicited opinions on their child and their care more often than you realize. Whether it\u2019s doctors or therapists offering insights, other parents of children with special needs sharing stories, or someone with no experience on the subject chiming in, they hear it all. The best thing you can do is let the parents come to their own conclusions. What works for one child may not work for another Autism isn\u2019t one size fits all. One child might have certain symptoms that were alleviated by doing one thing and another child might find no relief in that. It\u2019s a trial and error system that the parents have to go through in order to determine what works for their child. And symptoms and needs change all of the time, so this process happens regularly. This means that one co-worker\u2019s experience with autism may be different than another\u2019s, and because of that, their challenges and needs will be different, too. The future is unknown As with anything, the future is unknown. It can be triggering for a parent of an autisic child to be asked, \u201cWhat are you going to do in the future?\u201d or \u201cWhat are you going to do when they get older?\u201d. It can be isolating Parenting an autisic child can be lonely and overwhelming.

{"body_content_window": " So, many times, parents are having to make decisions in a vacuum. You might not be able to understand or relate, and that\u2019s OK. It\u2019s important to remember that though you may not be living their experience, there are things you CAN do to support these parents. Ask how you can help: if a co-worker seems to be going through a difficult time, ask specifically how you can help. Something as simple as, \u201cCan I move this deadline for you?\u201d or \u201cDo you want me to take on the presentation this time?\u201d may make a huge difference in their day. Listen (without giving advice): when your co-worker confides in you, listen with an open mind, and know that you don\u2019t have to solve their problems. Validating them goes a long way in breaking down the isolation some parents of special needs children feel. Advocate for and support them: whether it\u2019s getting involved with a cause, learning more about what they are going through, or helping them navigate challenges, your co-worker will likely appreciate knowing you have their back. Being understanding, flexible, and supportive can go a long way in making them able to both work and care for their child. Be a part of our flexible work culture.

And while burnout isn\u2019t new\u2014especially among working parents\u2014a Gallup study shows that employee levels of burnout remained high throughout the pandemic. This trend isn\u2019t something we want to see amongst Elasticians. In 2020, we encouraged conversations about mental health among employees, soliciting advice from Elasticians. We also introduced Shut It Down days at the start of the pandemic (and extended them until at least 2023) to ensure employees had extra time to recharge, but we\u2019ve also been working to provide more comprehensive mental healthcare benefits. As the entire world copes with what the end of the pandemic looks like and how to return to their previous life, mental health is very much in the spotlight. Dealing with anxiety, burnout, stress, and other mental health afflictions is just as important as maintaining and prioritizing your physical health. To support our Elasticians, we offer a variety of benefits related to mental health. Among them, a partnership with Ginger , a company that shares our belief that everyone should have access to mental healthcare. Ginger offers Elasticians in 28 countries on-demand, confidential emotional support through coaching via text-based chats, self-guided activities, video therapy, and psychiatry (US). There are coaches available 24/7 through live chat and there is in-app content and exercises that you can do on your own time. Plus, it\u2019s available for dependents of Elasticians through the age of 18. For US-based Elasticians, we work with Lyra to offer employees and their families 16 no-cost support sessions, either in-person or virtually. If you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, know that you\u2019re not alone. A recent report from Indeed found that employee burnout is on the rise: 52% of all workers are feeling burned out, up nine percent from a pre-COVID survey. If you\u2019re feeling depleted, distracted, or stressed, don\u2019t suffer in silence. In addition to seeking support, the Mayo Clinic offers a few ways to combat burnout: Start prioritizing.

We\u2019ve worked flexibility into our Source Code \u2014as part of our Home, Dinner tenet, we empower Elasticians to find balance through innovation and efficiency (and yes, be home for dinner). Cami Lewis, Global Security Lead - Community at Elastic, knows a thing or two about having to be flexible and innovative about how you work. She describes herself as a WAHM (Work at Home Mom) and has two boys\u20148 and 2 years old. \u201cI\u2019m a working (at home) mom balancing work and kids and doing all of the things,\u201d she says.", "name": "Someone Like Me: Cami Lewis on being a \u201cwork at home mom\u201d", "title": "Someone Like Me: Cami Lewis on being a \u201cwork at home mom\u201d | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-17", "byline": ["Elastic Culture"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/culture-someone-like-me-cami-lewis-on-being-a-work-at-home-mom"}
{"body_content_window": " But the flexibility and leave options that Elastic offers has allowed her to easily balance career and family. \u201cIt is Elastic\u2019s culture that makes it possible,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cThe working from home aspect makes it possible for me to be a career person and a mom at the same time. If it wasn\u2019t for that flexibility I would have to choose.\u201d Her older son is in school full-time and her younger son is in preschool part time, so between her and her husband, they tag team. \u2018\u201cAs long as I get my work done, I have a lot of control over my schedule, that\u2019s huge for me,\u201d Lewis says. She also has a global role and works with colleagues in the EMEA and APJ regions. Everyone keeps their calendars up to date with their working hours and availability and people respect that, she adds. Lewis\u2019s road to motherhood and being a work at home mom wasn\u2019t easy. She struggled with recurrent pregnancy loss, and then her and her husband decided to start the adoption process. They met all of the qualifications to adopt from Ethiopia, plus they wanted to adopt where there was the highest need. Lewis and her husband went to Ethiopia for a month to pick up their son and spend time in the country to get him comfortable with them before bringing him to the United States. Then, they came home and needed to acclimate to his new permanent home. Lewis wasn\u2019t working at Elastic at the time, and her then-company didn\u2019t recognize adoption as a parental leave scenario. So, she had to take paid time off and then use FMLA leave, which is a U.S labor law that provides job-protected, unpaid leave. She knew then that she needed to find a company that recognized adoptive parents as real parents. \u201cI needed to find a company that recognized adoption as a way to build a family,\u201d she says. \u201c Without parental leave, there\u2019s no way that we could do it again.\u201d At Elastic, we consider adoption as a way of building your family, so offer parental leave to Elasticians who are adopting. Even with parental leave and increased flexibility, Lewis and her husband are constantly juggling. \u201cIt feels like a circus act,\u201d she says. Here is her advice to other working parents: Have a consistent morning routine\u2014if the day doesn\u2019t start off right then it spirals from there. Embrace your inner early bird or night owl.", "name": "Someone Like Me: Cami Lewis on being a \u201cwork at home mom\u201d", "title": "Someone Like Me: Cami Lewis on being a \u201cwork at home mom\u201d | Elastic Blog", "publish_date": "2022-05-17", "byline": ["Elastic Culture"], "url": "https://www.elastic.co/blog/culture-someone-like-me-cami-lewis-on-being-a-work-at-home-mom"}
